Just like the Queen she entrusted her same wedding dress designer to create the gown she would wear at the coronation. (The Queen wore Norman Hartnell for both occasions and Kate has remained loyal to Alexander McQueen.) Kate, &nbsp;chose a Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen gown for her wedding in 2011.</p><p id=eLIR4sabP2bi data-wc=112>"One October afternoon in 1952, Her Majesty the Queen desired me to make for her the dress to be worn at her Coronation," Norman wrote in an abridged extract from his autobiography. "I can scarcely remember what I murmured in reply. In simple conversational tones the Queen went on to express her wishes. Her Majesty required that the dress should conform in line to that of her wedding dress and that the material should be white satin. It was almost exactly five years earlier that I had put the final touches to the dress which, as Princess Elizabeth, she had worn on the day of her wedding to the Duke of Edinburgh."</p><p id=e7Ef53logq data-wc=13><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>History of coronation fashion: from Queen Victoria to the late Elizabeth II</a></p><p id=ewusN6cajM2 data-wc=15><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Update your accessories for summer: Win a royal approved bag from Strathberry worth £445</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6007fef724f2-kate-hair-coronation.jpg><h2><strong>We analysed Princess Kate’s entire outfit for your sartorial pleasure:&nbsp;</strong></h2><h3><strong>Princess Kate’s Coronation Tiara</strong></h3><p id=eTQsbwPDmEra data-wc=63>Many thought that the Princess would wear a tiara, whereas in fact she opted for a dazzling headpiece. Her silver bullion, crystal and silver thread work three-dimensional leaf embroidery headpiece was by Jess Collett and Alexander McQueen. The Princess and Prince of Wales both wore formal robes and mantels, with the princess without a tiara, at the request of the King and Queen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0f32d3fe1555-kate-william-coronation.jpg><h3><strong>Princess Kate’s Coronation Dress</strong></h3><p id=edKFFlKpSJpG data-wc=49>Of course Kate wore a brilliant white gown by Alexander McQueen. The silver bullion and thread work embroidery features rose, thistle, daffodil and shamrock motifs – with the emblems signifying the four nations - the same floral stitching also appears on Princess Charlotte’s dress in ivory satin stitch embroidery.</p><h2>Princess Kate's Coronation Robe</h2><p id=ezl7-YzNTb data-wc=90>Wearing a deep blue Royal Victorian Order mantle edged in scarlet, Kate could not look more regal. The princess was made a Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) by the late Queen in 2019, so is now entitled to wear the Grand Cross Mantles of the Royal Victorian Order. The robe she wore over her gown is made from dark blue silk satin. The &nbsp;floor-length cloak is edged with scarlet and lined with white silk taffeta, with a hand embroidered badge and hood attached to right shoulder.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/03d9e3607866-kate-william-louis-charlotte.jpg><h3><strong>Princess Kate’s Coronation Jewellery</strong></h3><p id=e_n2gXIPDaRS data-wc=72>For jewellery Kate of course went classic. The princess’ earrings were a touching tribute to William’s late mother, with the pearl and diamond pieces belonging to Diana, Princess of Wales. She teamed it with Queen Elizabeth II’s George VI Festoon Necklace, which George VI commissioned for his daughter (then-Princess Elizabeth) in 1950. The glittering three strand necklace – a favourite of the late monarch’s – was made using 105 loose collet-set diamonds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/02479538694e-gettyimages-1487924862.jpg><p id=eCKT5SDsbK2I data-wc=21><strong>Like this story?</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our Hello!
