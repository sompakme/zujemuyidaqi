Seeing how most of the housemates aren’t speaking up for her it’s so sad, especially when Pere isn’t innocent of what he’s saying not to have said, because I know Doyin won’t sit and watch someone being treated inhumane and just sit and watch.I really hope Biggie address the issue and call out Pere’s abusive behaviour towards Doyin.<h2>Omashola likens Doyin to Big Brother's parrot</h2><p class=align-left>BBNaija All Stars houseguest, Omashola, entertained netizens with his conversations with his co-star, Doyin.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f0b723fb1f60ce4b.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>BBN All Stars' Omashola likens Doyin to Big Brother’s parrot in funny video, fans react: “She too dey talk”</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Omashola said that <a href=#>Doyin looked very much like Big Brother’s parrot</a>.
