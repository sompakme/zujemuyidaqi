The under-the-radar line is loved by shoppers who rave that it’s helped bring their hair back to life. Considering <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Jennifer Aniston’s hair stylist</a>, Chris McMillan, has even used Shu Uemura products to give her infamous locks more texture, I’m definitely adding a few products to my cart.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shop-top-rated-shu-uemura-products></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Shop Top-Rated Shu Uemura Products</span></h2><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shu-uemura-muroto-volume-shampoo-and-conditioner></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Shu Uemura Muroto Volume Shampoo and Conditioner</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shu Uemura</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shu Uemura</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although my tresses are typically <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>pretty thick and healthy</a>, I do still love using volumizing products when I want to create a big, bouncy blowout.

They’re each formulated with nutrient-rich “depsea water,” which is drawn from 200 hundred meters below the seas of Japan to help purify and hydrate strands, per the brand. They’re safe for color-treated hair, too, so if you bleached and broke off your hair like I did, they’re here to help.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shoppers with thinning hair rave about this duo, which is basically the only impetus I need to immediately add both to cart. Customers said the conditioner makes hair “feel strong and voluminous,” “doesn’t flatten,” and creates “healthy texture with added shine” for color-treated tresses. As for the shampoo, one shopper who lost all their hair said the duo (along with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Silk Bloom Mask</a>) is “the only line that helped” their strands and gave them “the best hair possible.” Another happy shopper said the shampoo makes hair feel “loose and voluminous all day" and "brings life into [their] flat, fine hair.” Well, I’m sold.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shu-uemura-silk-bloom-hair-mask></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Shu Uemura Silk Bloom Hair Mask</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shu Uemura</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If I had to pick only one type of hair product to use for the rest of my life, it would be a hair mask. I love how rich, thick, and lustrous my strands feel after slathering on a good mask — and, in the case of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Shu Uemura Silk Bloom Hair Mask</a>, my prayers have been answered. It’s formulated with argan oil, ceramides, and vitamin E to help nourish, repair, and restore damaged strands and leave them looking super sleek and silky. It’s especially good for those who heat style their hair — as someone who loves her flat iron and curling wand equally, that’s a surefire win. Satisfied shoppers said it “moisturizes without weighing down” and gives damaged hair “the ultimate reset.” Multiple shoppers also said it transforms hair, raving that their texture changed from “snarled, frizzy, and dry to supple, tame, and feeling moisturized,” and that “dry, brittle, newly color-treated hair” was “drenched in exquisite moisture.” Talk about next-level nourishment.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shu-uemura-izumi-tonic-thickening-serum></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Shu Uemura Izumi Tonic Thickening Serum</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shu Uemura</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another thickening product worth checking out from the brand is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Izumi Tonic Thickening Serum</a>. It’s formulated with a combination of nourishing ceramides and Japanese-sourced rice water, which is rich in amino acids, vitamin E, minerals, and antioxidants, to restore moisture and hydration to damaged hair. It also has an intoxicating scent of vibrant citrus and fresh woody musk. The brand even says it leaves hair 30 times stronger and reduces split ends up to 91 percent (as someone whose strands frequently split into about seven pieces, I’m certainly intrigued). Reviewers said it made their hair “soft and silky,” “smooth and manageable,” and “thicker” after just one use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re as ready to restore your thinning, damaged tresses as I am, be sure <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Shu Uemura’s hair line</a> may just be your answer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570qGsZq2VosKzrYyhmKKqXaW%2FsLDUnKusZWhqhnmEk24%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
