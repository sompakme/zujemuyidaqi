The decision comes on the heels of Meghan’s signing with powerhouse talent agency William Morris Endeavor (WME), with her team led by the successful Ari Emanuel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XgNeJNwGW2u666vE9x9RtQ-1920-80.jpg><p>“Harry and Meghan are reviewing their living options, with Malibu being a place of interest,” a source said. “They have secretly visited the area a couple of times and have been out and about, looking at what’s there.”</p><p>Meghan, of course, grew up in L.A., “and Meghan knows parts of the region from being there as a kid,” the source said. “It is uncertain if they will sell Montecito or just add a Malibu spot to buy.
