Back in 2021, she told ET: “We can’t stop, you know? We do have a purpose, all of us, and it’s important for my sons to see me moving forward with grief, not just curling up in a ball, because I curled up in a ball for a long time. But especially for my eldest son because he’s just a little more aware. But we will continue moving on as we had to, as he would want us to.”&nbsp;Check out her latest tribute to Nipsey Hussle on Instagram below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-lauren-london-honors-nipsey-hussle>Lauren London Honors Nipsey Hussle</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Nipsey and London met back in 2013 when London reached out to purchase copies of his Crenshaw mixtape. They welcomed their first child, Kross Ermias Asghedom, three years later in 2016. In 2019, Nipsey was shot and killed outside his Marathon Clothing store in Los Angeles. His killer, Eric R. Holder Jr, was eventually sentenced to 60 years in prison for the attack.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Cole Blake is currently an Editor at HotNewHipHop based out of Brooklyn, New York.
