Here's our explanation of the drama's ending…</strong></p><p id=ejbNnBvqFT5r data-wc=1><strong>MORE:<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Showtrial star is married to famous actress – find out more</a></strong></p><p id=eSxw4ZCoEbGG data-wc=84>The two characters accused of Hannah's murder – Talitha and Dhillon – have very different stories. While Dhillon admits that he helped to dispose of Hannah's body, he claimed that it was Talitha who accidentally strangled Hannah to death, and that he failed to notice until it was too late, then helped to hide her body while in a state of shock.<strong> Meanwhile, Talitha insists that she was never there at all that night, and that Dhillon acted alone. So what was the truth?</strong></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p style=text-align:center id=ek929m0E3KtQ data-wc=7><strong>WATCH: Have you finished the series yet?</strong></p><p id=ejS_Mot_TkqV data-wc=70>In the finale, the jury find Dhillon guilty and Talitha not guilty, leading Dhillon sentenced to spending a life sentence behind bars, while Talitha is free to go. In the final few minutes of the episode, Talitha visits her solicitor, Cleo, at her office. Smiling, she says:<strong> "We did it, Cleo. We so totally fooled them. Your face. I thought it didn't matter, I thought it was all about process."</strong></p><p id=e90enfXkmDP6><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/520ec7054e86-tally-cleo-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p style=text-align:center id=e_788qNzdYxh data-wc=6><strong>So did Talitha actually do it?</strong></p><p id=eI_aoLqMFiC1 data-wc=30>However, she then bursts out laughing, saying: "Gotcha!" But as she leaves, Cleo looks out at her window at Talitha, clearly doubting whether Talitha really was responsible for Hannah's death.</p><p id=egzheMnuKnaG data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Sherlock star Martin Freeman is unrecognisable in new BBC drama – but fans have same complaint</a></strong></p><p id=eLzpmZDa-5f_ data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Keeley Hawes' next major role revealed - and it sounds epic</a></strong></p><p id=eGqU6cto6nqX data-wc=42>As such, the show leaves this question somewhat open ended. While Talitha convinced the jury that she had nothing to do with Hannah's death, she was equally convincing when telling Cleo that she got away with it,<strong> leaving the conclusion deliberately ambiguous.</strong></p><p id=eN15-HZQ2I_7><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d6c2f0b20482-tally-dhillon-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p style=text-align:center id=ePMpuucy0Axy data-wc=11><strong>Dhillon's version of events is the only one depicted on screen</strong></p><p id=eZBo87oznC0C data-wc=69>The show may have also hinted that Dhillon's version of the night's events was also the truthful one as <strong>it showed a flashback to his story, in which both he and Talitha go to Hannah's house to make amends</strong>, with an amused Hannah allowing them in for more drinks. Meanwhile, Talitha's version – that she and Dhillon went home, chatted, and she fell asleep, was never depicted on screen.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e95e19674933-showtrial-7-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eSbKbs-5uWtA data-wc=5><strong>Did Dhillon really murder Hannah?</strong></p><p id=eeT8RIg9C5X8 data-wc=67>So what do you think? Viewers have had mixed responses to the ending, with one person writing: "We just finished watching #SHOWTRIAL<strong>. While I thoroughly enjoyed it, I hate that the ending is open to the viewers' interpretation.</strong> I’m the same with books; tell me what happened. Don’t expect me to write the end. I find it annoying & lazy. Does anyone else ever feel like that?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4a5de2998a1b-tally-ending-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eqir22lFgQZU data-wc=7><strong>What did you think of the ending?</strong></p><p id=eAV6kqY4uv8B data-wc=34>Another person tweeted: "What a brilliant cast. Absolutely gripping stuff, being tugged one way then the other.&nbsp;<strong>The ending though!&nbsp;Was I supposed to be thinking hmm??? But that was the beauty of it."</strong></p><p id=eCTpqjRWM6Ga data-wc=39>A third person added: "Just finished #SHOWTRIAL and <strong>god Dillon was telling the truth all along wasn't he???! </strong>The ending should have been Cleo looking out the window and seeing Talitha putting on that green scarf that she 'lost'."</p><p id=eJBm-PnQa5nI data-wc=14></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
