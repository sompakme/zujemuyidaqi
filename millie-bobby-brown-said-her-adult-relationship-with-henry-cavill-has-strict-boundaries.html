I met them when I was 10. So, for me, it does feel like your schoolmates," she told Deadline. &nbsp;"And with Henry, it feels like a real adult relationship."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added that their companionship does come with a set of boundaries. "[We have] like a really good friendship, a really healthy one. One that we have terms and conditions," she explained. "I know Henry. He has terms and conditions with me. I'm not allowed to ask about his personal life. It's like, 'Millie, shut up. No.' And I'm like 'Understood.' Whereas with the Stranger Things kids, it's different. There's no boundaries because it's like we're all siblings. But with Henry, he's very strict with me, which I appreciate."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The two also appeared on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Good Morning America</a> together where they spoke about their dynamic on set. "I'm from a family of five boys," Cavill said when asked what it was like having an on-screen sister. "So we're used to noise and making fun of each other all the time. And that's pretty much Millie. So there's no real difference."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brown laughed before chiming in, "No but I'm like a brother. I'm not really a sister. I'd be more like a brother."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zKKjpaGVYq%2BwrsGyZJuqn6y7brTEp6myZZOWw6q4y2adq6GVo7G0tMipZJunpaOxor7Inqpmbmhngnd%2Blg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
