Actress Lark Voorhies had a lengthy soap career and <a href=#>starred</a> as Wendy Reardon in Days of Our Lives, later taking on the role of Jasmine Malone in The Bold and the Beautiful. She even had a recurring role in LL Cool J's TV comedy, In the House. So, what happened?</p><p>In recent years, things have seemed tumultuous for Voorhies. In 2012, People ran a profile titled, "<a href=#>A Saved by the Bell Star's Sad Spiral</a>," where her mother claimed the actress had been diagnosed with <a href=#>bipolar disorder</a>. According to <a href=#>Radar Online</a>, Voorhies raised additional concerns with a bizarre, barely intelligible Entertainment Tonight&nbsp;interview, where she refuted her alleged diagnosis and claimed People had tricked her. "It is a small ... opinionata that is getting blown currently out of proportions," she said. "I have no stating reasons why anyone should worry about me. Clearly, I am a very strong, top-of-the line, always riding to it personage."</p><p>Since the shocking interview, Voorhies eloped in Las Vegas with <a href=#>alleged former gang member</a> Jimmy Green,&nbsp;<a href=#>filed for divorce</a> six months later, and slammed her ex in a&nbsp;<a href=#>lengthy, since-deleted Instagram rant</a>&nbsp;(though she later claimed her account was hacked). We're just speculating, but Voorhies' struggles might have contributed to the fact that she's had minimal on-screen credits since 2002.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam9jZX12e9iorGavn6PBbq7EpaCerpVixKmt02aroZ1dqK63scNmmbJlpJ2ybq7EpaNmm5GowW610mauqKqknXq1u8OasGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
