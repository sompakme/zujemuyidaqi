Conceived out of wedlock, she is brought up in the household as his ward until his death. After his passing, her cruel stepmother, named Araminta, forces her to work as a housemaid in her home before Sophie eventually runs away.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/03c4f208b99f-bridgerton203unit05161r.jpg><p id=e4ry5enhme2 data-wc=37>Although Sophie hasn’t been introduced in the TV show just yet, it appears that some tweaks might have been made to the books - and that the show will instead tie Sophie’s storyline to the Cowper family.&nbsp;</p><p id=emBm9cEqBkL data-wc=79>In the show, Cressida’s parents are both cruel and uncaring, pressuring her to wed during her third season out in society. While Cressida’s mother Lady Cowper’s first name isn’t revealed on the show the series’ wigmaker confirmed that her name is Araminta - the same as Sophie’s stepmother! The Instagram post read: “Fun fact - Lady Cowper’s first name is Araminta!” Either this is a pretty huge coincidence, or the TV show will make some changes to Sophie’s origins. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a3e535c1a293-bridgerton202unit05145r-1.jpg><p id=eUkrOeS008u data-wc=73>Unlike the books, Lady Cowper has two biological daughters. While one, Rosamund, is unkind and snobby, Posey is an ally of Sophie’s in the household. While Cressida was initially the villain of Bridgerton, season three has turned her into a more sympathetic character, making her the perfect friend to Sophie for the events of An Offer from a Gentleman - and so she represents an amalgamation of the two sisters for the show.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="13 stylish milkmaid dresses to live out your Bridgerton fantasy this summer" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/527f09f5f05b-best-milkmaid-dresses.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="13 stylish milkmaid dresses to live out your Bridgerton fantasy this summer" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>13 stylish milkmaid dresses to live out your Bridgerton fantasy this summer</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Is this Bridgerton season 3 moment the most unintentionally funny scene the show has ever done?" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/8a71e1254a37-bridgerton301unit01223r.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Is this Bridgerton season 3 moment the most unintentionally funny scene the show has ever done?" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Is this Bridgerton season 3 moment the most unintentionally funny scene the show has ever done?</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Bridgerton's Sam Phillips reveals hidden meaning in Lord Debling's costumes – exclusive" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/f03c8e76f4a2-sam-phillips-costumes-bridgerton.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Bridgerton's Sam Phillips reveals hidden meaning in Lord Debling's costumes – exclusive" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Bridgerton's Sam Phillips reveals hidden meaning in Lord Debling's costumes – exclusive</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e_9zzh_XaTeg data-wc=40>This wouldn’t be the first time that the TV show changes plot points from the novel.

So, will Araminta Cowper eventually become a widow, and is she already stepmother to Sophie Beckett who has been kept hidden away? We can’t wait to find out!&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/647140e75ed7-bridgerton303unit05549r.jpg><p id=e7pALdLMjo_w data-wc=54>Speaking about the revelation on social media, one fan wrote: “Omg.
