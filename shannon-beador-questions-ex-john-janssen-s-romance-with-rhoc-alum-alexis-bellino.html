Still, Shannon remained a staunch defender of their romance until the bitter end, so she was blindsided by his sudden and unexpected decision to call it quits. And when Shannon discovered Janssen had moved on to her fellow "RHOC" alum, Alexis Bellino, she was reeling.</p><p>"I'm not going to lie, I've been hurt," Shannon told <a href=#>E! News</a> on December 6, two days after learning the identity of Janssen's new squeeze.

Let's face it: hooking up with another Real Housewife isn't exactly going to guarantee anonymity. "He's thrust himself more into the public eye at this point," Shannon opined. Adding insult to injury is the fact that Janssen was aware of Shannon's legal struggles with Jim Bellino, a battle in which Alexis was very much involved. "I was financially and emotionally devastated for years," she said. "And I won. But it devastated me financially. And I'm a single mom. John's aware of that."</p><p><a href=#>People</a> broke the news of Alexis and Janssen's fledging romance. In a touch of dramatic irony, their first date was at the OC eatery, The Quiet Woman.
