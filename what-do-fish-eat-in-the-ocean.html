They eat each other: the big fish will hunt the smaller one someday and eat the fish that will be even bigger. Some eat plankton, and some eat everything they find in the ocean floor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt29v0hturs1ig.jpg><h3>Diet of fish according to their classifications</h3><p class=align-left>So, what do fish eat? The fish diet is very diverse: some are meat eaters who eat marine animals, including small fish, worms, and crustaceans.
