It’s clear that they would leave no stone unturned to fulfill their corporate social responsibility.</p><p>WWE even made a documentary about one of their super fans named Vladimir, who was known to show up at the biggest events of the year. The company never released the documentary for some reason, but Vladimir is currently suffering from several health issues. According to <a href=#>PW Insider</a>, the documentary is complete and Vladimir even got to see the completed documentary.</p><p>“Unfortunately, all is quiet on that front. I can confirm that several really wonderfully nice people in WWE made it possible for Vladimir to see the completed film, which I am personally thankful for as he’s dealing with a lot of permanent health issues and I know how much it cheered him up to see it. If I could give everyone one gift, it would be for them to be able to see the film as I think its a beautiful doc and really reminds people about why they first fell in love with pro wrestling and inspires them to really embrace what they love. It also tells the story of someone very important to me, so I really hope that sooner than later, WWE sees fit to finally release it. It’s an absolutely perfect doc in my mind, but again, we’re talking about someone I dearly love who is very much my brother, so I’m also going to be very biased about it. I just want him to be able to enjoy it being released while he truly has the ability to do so and everyone else to have the chance to enjoy it ASAP,” per PWInsider.</p><p>While it’s good that WWE went out of its way to please one of its fans, it’s still confusing why they haven’t released the documentary to the public. It will be interesting to see if they release it anytime soon.
