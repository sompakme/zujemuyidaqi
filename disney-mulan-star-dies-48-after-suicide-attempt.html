Although CoCo sought professional help and did her best to fight depression, sadly that demon inside of her took the better of her,” the Lee sisters <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/CuUQMDyrt-g/?img_index=1">said in a Facebook/Instagram post.</a></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“On 2 July, she committed suicide at home and was sent to the hospital.

After high school, Lee attended the University of California at Irvine, but her burgeoning pop singing career in Hong Kong eventually won out and she had an eventual commercial breakthrough in Asia.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She rode to the top of the Mandarin and Cantonese pop music markets, and her English-language performances included singing the song “Before I Fall In Love” for the Runaway Bride soundtrack, and the theme song “A Love Before Time” for the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&nbsp;movie, which she performed at the 2001 <a href=# id=auto-tag_academy-awards_1 data-tag=academy-awards>Academy Awards</a>. &nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Lee also voiced the lead character in the Mandarin version of <a href=# id=auto-tag_disney-2_1 data-tag=disney-2>Disney</a>‘s <a href=# id=auto-tag_mulan_1 data-tag=mulan>Mulan</a> tentpole. Her family in the social media post paid tribute to the hospital workers who cared for Lee and said their immediate thoughts were with her grieving mother.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“As a family of CoCo, we are very grateful and honored to have such an excellent and outstanding sister. We are thankful to God for giving us such a kind angel. We know now she has gone to a happier place and no longer suffers from depression; we trust God has her best interest looked after! Now, our greatest responsibility is to take good care of our elderly mother. I hope everyone will pray for this poor old lady & allow us time & privacy in healing,” the Lee sisters wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKS7wqhkpZ2VYrGmrcNmm6KrnprGbrnUpZinZaOprrN5w6KcrGWjqraktcOeZGpqY2qCc4WVamdo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
