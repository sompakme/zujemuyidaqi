On Wednesday, the actor shared with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>People</a> that, despite his daughter’s young age of two, he feels she is growing up fast and is his number one supporter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She's beautiful, she's growing fast, big, strong and healthy. And you can't be more blessed than that," Bloom told the outlet through his partnership with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Form Nutrition</a>. "And literally, I kid you not, she's like, 'Daddy, can I have a smoothie?' You know what she gets? She gets Form. We are very blessed."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bloom and Katy Perry welcomed their first child together, Daisy Dove, on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Aug. 26, 2020</a>, and ever since, they have been a united force through thick and thin. Bloom credits his fiancée as his "biggest fan" and support system.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think we support each other because we are fans of one another, you know what I mean?," he told the publication. "What she does is so empowering for young musicians with everything with [American] Idol. Then she can go and put on a powerhouse show in Vegas. We support, it's who we are. Katy's a force and we both have these pools we swim in, and we recognize each other's pools and we go, 'Hey, I'm over here. We're doing this.' And it's great."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from being a proud father of two (he shares son Flynn with his ex-wife, Miranda Kerr), Bloom is adding Chief Wellness Officer to his list of accolades. He’s teamed up with the aforementioned nutrition brand to launch the company's sustainable, plant-based protein powder and vegan multivitamins in the United States. And who better to lead the initiative than Bloom who always makes wellness a priority.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Tristan Kallas</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I have a daily routine and part of that is I work out, I try to move my body every day. I try to have a positive attitude towards that and health and wellness at all times," Bloom said. "I have a great list of recipes for how I like to use Form in my daily routine and just a flavor thing as much as it is a product. It's simply a product that I really love and enjoy and I'm seeing the results. I see the results in the gym, I see the results in my life, I see the results in my well-being, in my mental health."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zqujmqaUpHqjuM6opGajkamybrzEq6myZZKhsrS%2FxJ1knZmlnLW1sdFmbmttZW2CeQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
