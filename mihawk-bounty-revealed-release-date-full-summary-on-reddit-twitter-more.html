This is like the top 10 biggest and most exciting reveals in the series probably like if the title of the article didn’t already get the dopamine flowing don’t worry because there’s so much more that we have to go over than just me hawks bounty. We’re gonna have a lot of fun with this one. So let’s just get into it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Major_Bounty_Revealed_in_One_Piece_Chapter_1058></span><strong>Major Bounty Revealed in One Piece Chapter 1058</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Major-Bounty-Revealed-in-One-Piece-Chapter-1058.jpg><p>All the new bounties of the straw hat crew are revealed. Zoro is 1,101,000,000 berries, Jinbe’s is 1,100,000,000 Berries, Sanji is 1,032,000,000 Berries, Robin’s is 930,000,000 Berries, Usopp is 500,000,000 Berries, Franky is 394,000,000 Berries, Brook is 383,000,000 Berries, Nami is 366,000,000 Berries and Chopper is 1000 Berries. So this is amazing. And I’m pretty satisfied with these. I mean, of course, they could be higher, but I’m just grateful that they’re at least 1 billion for the characters that deserve it of course such as Zoro.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=One_Piece_Chapter_1058_Release_Date_Time></span><strong>One Piece Chapter&nbsp;1058 Release Date & Time</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular"></figure><p>This was one of the major things that I wanted coming out of Wano because obviously, he deserves it. He just soloed a guy with a 1.3 billion bounty and King and now he’s you know, the right hand of the Yonko. And he’s freaking Zoro, so it’s just so satisfying to just finally see that he has a worthy bounty and like I say could be higher for sure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/One-Piece-Chapter-1058-Release-Date-Time.jpg><p>But this is good enough for me at least just right now we still have plenty of time in the One Piece manga series for their bounties to increase of course, so it’s not like this is his cap or anything. But Jinbe here is kind of surprising.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=One_Piece_Chapter_1058_Full_Summary_Initial_Leaks_Hints></span><strong>One Piece Chapter 1058 Full Summary (Initial Leaks & Hints)</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>And to be honest, I don’t know what I was really expecting of Jinbe bounty to be posted on Wano. But I’m not mad at all that it’s 1.1 billion. Now, does that mean that he’s like undisputedly the number two of the straw hat crew? Not necessarily because, you know, obviously, we all know at this point that bounties don’t directly correlate to one’s power level.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/About-One-Piece-1058-Manga.jpg><p>Although, you know, let’s not kid ourselves. There’s somewhat of an indication of it for sure. Jinbe’s bounty is higher than Sanji. So does that mean that he’s not only stronger than Sanji but has a higher place on the crew? Well, of course not. This could just be like a funny little thing, maybe at least to just cause friction between Sanji and Jinbe possibly aside from this friction that Sanji eternally has with Zoro.</p><p>But I also liked that Sanji has, you know, a 1 billion bounty for sure definitely deserves it. I mean, especially since he soloed queen and now has this unbelievable power of. But I also just really liked that, you know, we have the three Yonko Commanders under Luffy here with all somewhat worthy of the bounties of that right?</p><p class=has-background><strong>READ ALSO</strong>:- <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One Piece Chapter 1057 Spoilers (Full Details)</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/OnePieceAnime/status/1560778990100553732</p></figure><p>And as for Robin with her new 930 million bounties, that’s obviously worthy to her for different reasons, of course, not because of her power. And speaking of that, does she have like the highest bounty of a person who likes doesn’t use Haki?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/One-Piece-Chapter-1058-Full-Summary-Initial-Leaks-Hints.jpg><p>And some of you might say like, Oh, she actually used Haki in that move against Black Maria, maybe, maybe not, but she’s clearly not using Haki in the traditional sense, like what has become the standard of the New World. That aside, her bounty is so high because of the threat that she represents to the World Government. Obviously, she’s a survivor of Ohara. So, she has tons of forbidden knowledge, and she can read the poneglyphs, and then Chopper having 1000 here is for the gag of it of course.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=About_One_Piece_1058_Manga></span><strong>About One Piece 1058 Manga</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/One-Piece-1058-Manga-CROSS-GUILD.jpg><p>He originally had like a 100 bounty because he was mistaken as the pet of the Straw Hats and I guess that really hasn’t changed. And as for the rest of the straw hat bounties here, I’ll go over it in my next article, that’s going to be the full summary for the chapter that might come out tomorrow or Thursday, so please subscribe for that if you haven’t already.</p><p>But yeah, this is just all amazing stuff. Like I’m so hyped over this. I don’t know why the bounty reveals are just so exciting to me. But this is always such an awesome time in the One Piece 1058 Manga series when we get this information reveal and it really just hits the spot. You know, it’s just so satisfying to see those numbers.</p><p>Buggy is not the leader of the Cross Guild.”</p><p>He is one of the new Emperors by a mistake of the Navy.</p><p>Buggy owes a huge debt to someone.</p><p>Crocodile was the founder of the Cross guild. Mihawk received an invitation to join and he accepted it. And since Buggy’s face was in the middle, the Marines thought that Buggy is the leader of the guild. So Oh that’s odd but kind of funny I guess right that’s the whole point of it but interesting that crocodile was actually the founder of the cross guild.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=One_Piece_Chapter_1058_Spoilers_Leaked_on_Reddit_Twitter></span><strong>One Piece Chapter 1058 Spoilers Leaked on Reddit & Twitter</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>This is something that of course we didn’t know initially we had very little information to go off of anyway with the cross guild but now we know that it’s crocodile for sure. And I also think that’s interesting that Mihawk accepted the invitation I mean, it’s somewhat understandable because you know, Mihawk is wanted again since the warlord system had been abolished and the crocodile was like a former warlord he was like against the first one who was banished from the right free Timescape and they did clash at Marine forts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/One-Piece-Chapter-1058-Spoilers-Leaked-on-Reddit-Twitter-1024x633.jpg><p>So maybe Mihawk found some kind of respect for Crocodile, but I’m not really sure why he invited Buggy maybe just because of the notoriety or maybe he developed some kind of camaraderie with Buggy you know, considering he was a part of the whole impel down thing too, but as for Buggy owing a huge debt to someone I don’t really sure what this means it could be a pirate could be a Marine, but now let’s get into the real juicy stuff the title of this article because Mihawk’s bounty is revealed to be 3,590,000,000 Berries. Yeah, I know crazy. And I’m not necessarily surprised by the amount.</p><p>I’m just surprised in general that we’re finally getting to see it. I also assume that it’s increased somewhat because his original bounty was frozen when he became a warlord and now you know that he’s back to being a pirate again, especially now that he’s with the Cross Guild I’m sure it’s increased somewhat maybe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/All-the-New-bounties-of-the-Straw-Hat-Crew-are-Revealed.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=One_Piece_Chapter_1058_Wiki></span><strong>One Piece Chapter 1058 Wiki</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>But Mihawk now officially has like one of the highest bounties in the One Piece Manga series because the original Yonko bounties were Blackbeard having 2.2 billion Shanks having 4,048,000,000, Big Mom having 4.3 billion, and Kaido having 4.6 billion. So this is like certainly worthy of a Yonko bounty for sure, right? Because he’s higher than both Luffy and Blackbeard right now.</p><p>And speaking of Blackbeard his bounty is kind of low at this point, but I’m assuming he’ll definitely increase it somewhat. Maybe if he tries to go after pluton at Wano and successfully gets it which I think he will and then that’ll shoot him up to like, I don’t know maybe 5 billion or something.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/One-Piece-Chapter-1058-Wiki.jpg><p>But we also have Buggy’s bounty here and it’s 3,189,000,000 Berries. So I know hilarious because Buggy has no business having a bounty this incredibly high. But you know, it’s a part of the gag and you know, he’s a Cross Guild mistakenly labeled as a Yonko. And it’s higher than Luffy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=All_the_New_bounties_of_the_Straw_Hat_Crew_are_Revealed></span><strong>All the New bounties of the Straw Hat Crew are Revealed</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>And it makes me wonder like what was Buggy like real bounty be? Would it even be like 100 million? And then lastly, we have Crocodile’s new bounty here. And it’s 1,965,000,000 This is incredible.</p><p>This is like a major glow-up for Crocodile because his original frozen bounty was like 81 million I think now, does this mean that Crocodile is now strong enough to have a 1.9 billion bounty? Well, not really sure. I have only seen a couple of panels of him post-Timescape. But I also wouldn’t be surprised if he’s just like, way stronger than what we initially thought him to be. Especially because like from alabaster to Marineford he seemingly had a spike in power.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/About-One-Piece-Chapter-1058-Spoilers.jpg><p>And I assume that was out for making him powerful enough so that it made sense for the story to be compelling at that point in time. But who knows what he did post Time Skip, maybe he did some training or something.</p><p>And even if he did it, I don’t really mind him just suddenly being strong enough to compete with everyone else. At this point. I personally really like Crocodile. As I said, I love his whole character shifts since impel down, and now it seems like he’s going to be, you know, a much more important figure in the story going forward. And I’m totally on board with it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Know_Everything_about_One_Piece_Chapter_1058_Spoilers></span><strong>Know Everything about One Piece Chapter 1058 Spoilers</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>At the end of the One Piece Chapter 1058 spoiler. The Revolutionary Army receives a call. It’s me, Sabo. So what a strange way to end this chapter with all this information in it, but as far as I know, the last time we saw Sabo was when we heard that he had successfully saved Kuma from Mary Sue, and he was also getting like some serious hype as like pretty much becoming the new poster boy for the Revolutionary Army even more so than like Dragon and since it’s the end of the chapter, this might be the final panel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/One-Piece-1058-Ending-Explain.jpg><p>So I doubt we’re going to get any more information on what’s going on here. But at least you know, we can just get to the bottom of what’s going on with them. But yeah, that’s pretty much it for this spoiler today, guys. This was so exciting.</p><p>And I just can’t wait to go over the One Piece Chapter 1059 summary later this week, because obviously there’s way more that’s happening in this One Piece 1058 chapter than just these bounty reveals but let me know what you think about them in the comments.
