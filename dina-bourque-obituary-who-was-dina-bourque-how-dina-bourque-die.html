While our community mourns her untimely departure, let us remember and honor a life who made an indelible mark upon those she touched with both education and kindness.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who Was Dina Bourque?</strong></h2><p>Dina Bourque was an exceptional leader who dedicated herself to nurturing young minds throughout Iberia Parish.

She will always be missed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why Is She Admired as Principal?</h2><p>Bourque took an holistic approach to education. She believed in providing her students with both intellectual and emotional nourishment; this philosophy made her much more than a principal; it rendered her as mentor, confidante, and role model – her genuine care for their holistic development echoed across school walls and fostered a strong community spirit that went far beyond typical teacher/student relationships.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Have the Communities Responded?</h2><p>News of Bourque’s death sent shockwaves through her community.

By instilling this philosophy into her students, Dina sought to foster an environment in which students could extend this kindness far beyond school walls and become responsible members of society themselves.
