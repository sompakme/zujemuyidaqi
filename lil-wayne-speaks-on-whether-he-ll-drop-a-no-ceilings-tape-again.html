However, the game is very different to what it was when he exploded onto the scene. As such, the New Orleans legend thinks very differently about the process of dropping mixtapes these days- and their viability as a whole. While on The Pivot Podcast, Weezy answered whether he'd be down to drop another tape in the No Ceilings series, which featured popular rap instrumentals of the time behind his bars. To put it bluntly, it seems unlikely, but his explanation paints a much more complex picture.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">The times changed</a>," Lil Wayne remarked to the hosts when asked about No Ceilings. "So what happened is, back then, I could do that. Nowadays, if I do that, the times have changed so much to where nothing is official as far as [dropping] an official album. They don't do that. What happened is, as soon as we put that out, Drama might put [on] a whole event, it's gon' go down. As soon as it drop, those artists are calling our people like, 'Aye, we want that to be a single.'</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-lil-wayne-responds-to-question-about-no-ceilings-next-installment>Lil Wayne Responds To Question About No Ceilings' Next Installment</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Yeah, and 'We don't need no date,'" Lil Wayne continued. "They about to pull that off, pay how much you want to pay for it, boom, that's the original new verse. Ain't no such thing as a remix no more, so that's all it really is. That's their new single, we [might] shoot a video and everything. And that's what takes the allure of what I was doing."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Of course, considering the sample-based concepts of many of his mixtapes, it's understandable why the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Young Money</a> boss' elevated status makes that run a bit tougher. The times have changed indeed, and an artist of Wayne's caliber isn't expected to forego commercial opportunities for the sake of releasing music. That being said, with a <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Benny The Butcher</a> collab <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">on the horizon</a>, there will surely be no shortage of excellent verses from Tunechi.
