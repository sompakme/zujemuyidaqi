And if you wanna try some, it's gonna cost you," said Derek Wilcox, chef at Shoji in New York told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Business Insider.</a></p><p>"Bluefin is the most sought after. Only bluefin has the intense marbling. Bluefin also, when it's aged properly, has a particular balance of flavors," Wilcox said.</p><p>Two years ago, Wicked Tuna's Paul Hebert received the highest amount of price per pound that he had ever received for one of his catches.</p><p>He said he secured $47.02 for a fish he caught in the July season. Although he didn't reveal how heavy the catch was, he may have pocketed upwards of $47,000 should the tuna have weighed more than 1,000 pounds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000639446614.jpg><p>"I had brought in one of the only tuna that on the market at that time. To this day, I still have the text from the buyer saved on my phone."</p><p>On Wicked Tuna, Paul also caught the biggest bluefin, <a href=#>weighing in at 1,287 pounds</a>.</p><p>Prices are so high for bluefin due to the limited supply of the species of tuna in the ocean. Bluefin are overfished and do not breed in captivity.</p><h2>What happened to Duffy from Wicked Tuna?</h2><p><a href=#>Duffy's cause of death wasn't announced at the time of his passing</a> almost three years ago, but fans were shocked to learn that he died so suddenly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000639089957-3.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>His colleagues inferred that he may have succumbed to "the bends" or decompression sickness.</p><p>Decompression sickness, also called generalized barotrauma, "refers to injuries caused by a rapid decrease in the pressure that surrounds you, of either air or water," according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harvard Health</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Although it most commonly affects deep-sea divers and scuba divers, it also can occur during high-altitude or unpressurized air travel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hqZGl%2FdYCVaK6im5uasW7A1KeYZqWfqMFusdepnKermauybq7OmqtmppGptrC6wKVkoJ2fnL%2BivMeimmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
