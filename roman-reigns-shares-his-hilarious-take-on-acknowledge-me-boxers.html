The Head Of The Table rules Friday Night Smackdown with an iron fist, and that won’t be changing anytime soon. WWE Shop is now selling Roman Reigns inspired ‘Acknowledge Me’ boxers on their website.</p><p>At the WWE Shop, fans may purchase memorabilia from their favorite WWE superstar, including items that aren’t featured in media. A pair of Roman Reigns boxer briefs with the words ACKNOWLEDGE ME emblazoned over the crotch are one item offered for the modest cost of $24.99 on the website. Roman smiled and stated he didn’t know those were manufactured when the boxers were introduced to him during a podcast interview with <a href=#>Jimmy Traina for Sports Illustrated Media.</a></p><p>That’s when you drop them and there are no words needed. I’m trying to help my people out. Strong and silent. It’s for the shy guys. You know what they say about shy guys, right?</p><p>Roman made no further inquiries regarding what is claimed about the shy guys. Fans can get WWE Championship boxers, Steve Austin boxers, Brock Lesnar boxers, and more if Roman Reigns boxers aren’t their thing. Reigns also intends to make Drew McIntyre acknowledge him when he defends the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at WWE Clash at the Castle.</p><p>Roman Reigns was also recently asked about starting his <a href=#>own podcast</a>. Reigns made it clear that he is open to launching his own podcast with The Usos. Let’s see what’s in store for Reigns in the future.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this unique piece of merchandise?
