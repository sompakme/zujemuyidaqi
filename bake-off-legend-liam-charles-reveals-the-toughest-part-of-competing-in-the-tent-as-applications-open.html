Also, it’s just nice to know that I work with a production company that want the best for the bakers and genuinely believes in them."</p><p>As a former contestant it's little surprise that Liam remains a fan of the show that made him famous.</p><p>He was full of praise for this year's winner Syabira and was impressed with her progression over the course of the show.</p><p>"I have been watching it and think the bakers are sick this year!" he said. "I also watched the final and&nbsp;what a great winner! Syabira definitely grew as the weeks went by but overall, she absolutely smashed it. To be honest any the finalist could have won so it made for a brilliant watch!"</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>Liam is now using his platform to help combat food wastage by teaming up with Hellmann's, who have launched the free Fridge Night App to help people reimagine their leftovers.</p><p>The initiative, which comes after research found food waste is costing families £780 per year on average, is one Liam is passionate about.</p><p>He said: "Food waste is really close to my heart – I can’t bear the thought of throwing food away,&nbsp;so my biggest rule of thumb is&nbsp;not to&nbsp;overcook. But, if you do, my best advice is to use the Hellmann’s Fridge Night app to reimagine your leftovers or freeze up leftovers into portions and save for another day.</p><p>"It’s an easy way to save money too! Since I partnered with Hellmann’s, I’ve been using the app’s easy step-by-step flexible recipe method to make the most of my leftovers and avoid&nbsp;food waste.&nbsp;The idea is that you put together a leftover protein, any veggies, a carb, and a magic touch ingredient, such as Hellmann’s mayonnaise, to create a tasty dish. It’s a great approach to creating delicious recipes out of the foods left at the back of your fridge.&nbsp;</p><p>"The amazing thing about leftovers is that they can go into so many recipes, but sometimes it can be hard to find inspiration on what to create – that’s why I love Hellmann’s ‘flexipes’ from the Fridge Night app.&nbsp;</p><p>"I’ve been using the tool to find recipes for my leftover foods and my favourite so far is definitely the Pizza Wrap Hack. We always have some sort of wraps, left over peppers and maybe a few chunks of chorizo in the fridge, add a spread of tomato sauce, a mix of Hellmann’s mayo, a sprinkle of cheese and you’ve got an easy makeshift pizza on your hands. It’s my nephew’s favourite too!"</p><p><strong>To find&nbsp;out more or start your Fridge Night journey, visit&nbsp;<a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">https://www.hellmanns.com/uk/fridge-night.html</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mark-bourdillon-channel-4-television-347232031.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmK8rbCOb25ramBmf3CuwKScZqeWm3qttcCmZJygkae5pr%2BMraaun5iawLV5wqikqZ2knruoecCpp6Whk5bBqrvNaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
