We lost a slate off the roof, in that wind last night and now the drains are blocked now, with all the leaves. Oh, I hate Autumn, don’t you? And then there’s Christmas - only six weeks away but the cards have been in the shops since August Bank Holiday and you have to queue for everything….!</p><p>I feel better for that little outburst– and I’m not alone. A good moan is one of the defining characteristics of the British, according to new research released by the global <a href=# lang=en.uk>research company OnePoll.</a></p><p>We're also obsessed with class, queueing and we're terrible dancers. But mostly, we're moaners.</p><p>So when does the moan swingometer tip from the occasional grizzle to the “she never stops moaning” danger area? A good test is that, unless you’re talking to a doctor, the answer to “How are you?” should always be “Fine.” Anyone close to you knows exactly how you are - and the rest of us aren’t remotely interested.</p><p>Knowing that, I thought I was a moanachondriac – obsessed with the fear that, when someone asks ‘How are you?’, I might actually tell them. But I realise it's too late.</p><p>Evenings with friends that were once punctuated by the pop of corks and the jangle of costume jewellery, are now defined by the rattle of a handbag full of vitamins and supplements and the cry of “Still or sparkling?”. “Has yours gone any higher?” is no longer a discussion about soufflés or overdrafts. It’s about blood pressure. “Do you grunt when you sit down?”, we ask each other. “No, but I have to push my hands down on my knees to get up from a crouching position.” “You can CROUCH..?!”</p><p>But our biggest moan is about the state of our teeth - or rather, gums. "My gums used to be straight. Now they’re more like the Alps. Do you think Joanna Lumley has got false gums?"</p><p>We may try not to, but we moan about everything - health, house prices but mostly, husbands. “One of the many annoying things about Gerald,” says Kate, “ is that he drops off to sleep after the lunchtime news. He claims 'Winston Churchill always took a power nap’. I say 'Yes, well, he had power. He was running the country. All you’ve got to do is take the bins out.'”</p><p>Perfect. End a good moan with a good laugh.</p><p>But, hold on... there’s nothing funny about what’s going on in the world today, is there? My savings have plummeted, since the interest rate cut. And you try to get a plumber out on a Saturday night….</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaJuforqmutNop56qo6S7oriMr6Cer19ognd%2FknJtaIWflruqusZmoKxln6q%2FbrDEn6CnoZ6ceoO%2ByK2grKBdmLWivsCcq56qmajBqq%2BNoaumpA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
