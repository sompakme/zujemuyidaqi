O’Marcaigh accuses Combs of <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">sexually assaulting her on a yacht</a> where she worked as a crew member, leased by his family in December 2022. She claims that one morning, Combs pressured her to drink a shot of tequila he brought aboard. Shortly after, the alleged assault took place. Per her lawsuit, she believes the alcohol may have been laced with drugs.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Now, it's been revealed that O’Marcaigh allegedly has audio recordings of her encounter with Combs, captured by none other than Rodney <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Lil Rod"</a> Jones. Jones is currently suing Diddy for alleged sexual misconduct. According to O’Marcaigh, the producer was working alongside Combs in a studio on the yacht.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-diddy-named-as-defendant-in-grace-o-marcaigh-s-lawsuit-against-christian-combs>Diddy Named As Defendant In Grace O’Marcaigh's Lawsuit Against Christian Combs</h2></span><p>Sean Combs and King Combs pose in the press room at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards at Prudential Center on September 12, 2023 in Newark, New Jersey.

I’ll move my legs where I want to,” a woman is heard saying in the recording. “If I want to do this, then I will. You don’t touch my legs like that.”&nbsp;O’Marcaigh then allegedly tells Combs she must leave the studio to get back to work. “Who can I talk to? I’m going to say I requested you right now,” he asked her. “Well, you can take your hand off my a** for the first thing,” she responded. O’Marcaigh says the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">alleged assault</a> had a profound impact on her mental well-being and is seeking unspecified damages.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Combs' father Diddy, who has <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">also been in the hot seat</a> in recent weeks, is named as a defendant in the lawsuit.
