Jackson</a>‘s assertion that <a href=# id=auto-tag_donald-trump data-tag=donald-trump>Donald Trump</a> cheats at golf.</p><p>In early January, after Jackson claimed in an interview that the Republican candidate is a cheater, <a href=# rel=noopener>Trump shot back</a> with a Tweet saying he didn’t know Jackson and had never golfed with him. But Anderson backed up Jackson’s account, tweeting that in fact the three men had golfed together at Trump’s course in <span data-scayt_word=Bedminster data-scaytid=15>Bedminster</span>.</p><p>“Trump is a great golfer. I’m not going to say Trump cheats,” Anderson told Meyers. “His caddy cheats for him.”</p><p>Meyers asked if Anderson actually saw the cheating happening.</p><p>“Oh yes, several times. Several times,” said Anderson. “I <span data-scayt_word=mis-hit data-scaytid=16>mis-hit</span> a ball — it hooked a little left about 20 yards. Trump hit the exact same shot but went 20 yards further left than mine. I could not find my ball in this trash. Trump’s ball had the fluffiest lie in the middle of the fairway. Like I say, I didn’t see Trump cheat because he was on the t-box with me, but his ball was right there in the middle of the fairway.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Meyers then asked Anderson if he knew who he was going to vote for in the presidential race.</p><p>“I know who I’m not voting for,” Anderson replied. “The black guy.”</p><p>“You’re not going to be voting for Dr. Ben Carson,” said Meyers.</p><p>“I mean ’cause you know a lot of people said I and a lot of the people in the African-American community only voted for Barack Obama because he was black,” said Anderson. “That theory does not hold any weight because I don’t know any Negro that’s voting for Ben Carson. I mean his wife isn’t even voting for him. I saw her with a ‘Go Hillary’ button on the other day.”</p><p>Anderson also explained that while he’s been vocal about his objections to the lack of diversity in the Academy Awards, he is a little concerned with overcorrecting for the problem in the years to come.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don’t want the Oscars to start giving awards out of guilt for what they did this year and last year,” said Anderson. “I would hate to see best film —&nbsp;made by Tyler Perry, <span data-scayt_word=Medea data-scaytid=18>Medea</span> Trick or Treats in Compton. That wouldn’t fix the problem.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOmqWtoJ%2Bjxm6tzZ2cq6ufo3qzscKao6WrXZ28uHnDqKWapJRihXeClWtpaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
