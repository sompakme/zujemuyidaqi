Such is the case for First Blood. That’s right. The first Rambo movie, released in 1982, could be considered a Christmas movie. The fictitious town of Hope, which John Rambo finds himself in, is clearly decorated for Christmas. See: the Christmas tree in the police station.</p><p></p><p><span data-scayt_word=?Lethal data-scaytid=6><strong>?</strong><strong>Lethal</strong></span><strong> Weapon (1987)</strong></p><p>Lethal Weapon is another film with a lot of background holiday imagery. In fact, the audience first meets <a href=# id=auto-tag_mel-gibson data-tag=mel-gibson>Mel Gibson</a>‘s Riggs character in a Christmas tree lot while he’s making an undercover drug bust. The final fight between Riggs and villain Joshua, played by Gary&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Busey data-scaytid=7>Busey</span>, is right outside the home of <span data-scayt_word=Murtaugh data-scaytid=31>Murtaugh</span> (Danny Glover), which is all decorated for Christmas — and has a huge hole in it from where a car drove through. The film ends with Riggs spending Christmas Day with the&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Murtaugh data-scaytid=5>Murtaugh</span>&nbsp;family.</p><p></p><p><span data-scayt_word=?Batman data-scaytid=10><strong>?</strong><strong>Batman</strong></span><strong> Returns (1992)</strong></p><p>Batman Returns, the sequel to Tim Burton’s 1989 film, also takes place at Christmas. One of the bigger action sequences takes place during the Gotham tree-lighting ceremony. There are numerous references to the holiday, including&nbsp;the gigantic tree poor Alfred has to trim in Wayne Manor. The last line in the 1992 film, spoken by Michael Keaton’s Wayne: “Merry Christmas, Alfred. Good will toward men … and women.”</p><p></p><p><span data-scayt_word=?Gremlins data-scaytid=11><strong>?</strong><strong>Gremlins</strong></span><strong> (1984)</strong></p><p>While maybe not in the same action realm as the aforementioned,&nbsp;Gremlins is another film that can be considered a holiday movie. In the 1984 comedy/action/horror <span data-scayt_word=pic data-scaytid=36>pic</span>, executive produced&nbsp;by Steven Spielberg, the cute little creature Gizmo is a Christmas gift from father to son.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, all hell breaks loose after Gizmo gets wet, and the ensuing action with all his evil spawn revolves&nbsp;around the holiday. There is also a good little scare when one of the Gremlins jumps out of the&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Peltzer data-scaytid=12>Peltzer</span> family’s Christmas tree.</p><p></p><p><strong>?</strong><strong>Die Hard (1988)</strong></p><p>The action movie most considered to also be a Christmas flick by fans is Die Hard. “Now I have a machine gun. HO-HO-HO.” This is just one of the many classic lines from the 1988&nbsp;John <span data-scayt_word=McTiernan data-scaytid=13>McTiernan</span> film starring <a href=# id=auto-tag_bruce-willis data-tag=bruce-willis>Bruce Willis</a>.</p><p>The story is about a New York cop just trying to reconnect with his family for the holidays when in walk some terrorists set to wreak havoc during a Christmas party.</p><p>From the moment&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=McClane data-scaytid=14>McClane</span>&nbsp;arrives in Los Angeles and hears Run-D.M.C.’s “Christmas in Hollis” in the limo taking him to his wife’s holiday party, it’s clear the festive season will be intertwined&nbsp;with the unfolding action.&nbsp;</p><p>Christmas is mentioned numerous times throughout the movie, and in the <span data-scayt_word="pic's" data-scaytid=45>pic’s</span> climax,&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=McClane data-scaytid=16>McClane</span> uses Christmas-themed wrapping tape to secure his gun to his back before taking out the bad guy.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofLq1z6mgnmWbnnq6rdhmmJysmaS7brnOr6Ceq11tgnGClG1m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
