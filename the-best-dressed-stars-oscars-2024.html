Among the night’s biggest fashion surprises: Margot Robbie eschewed her now-trademark pink in favor of a beautifully sculpted <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/margot-robbie-oscars-2024-red-carpet-look-1235848479/>gown in deep brown by Versace</a> — and it was <a href=# id=auto-tag_america-ferrera_1 data-tag=america-ferrera>America Ferrera</a> who embraced Barbie’s signature color in a stunning pink chainmail dress, also by <a href=# id=auto-tag_versace_1 data-tag=versace>Versace</a>.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Indeed, Robbie turned out to be prescient with her choice of color, as <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/style/barbie-cast-oscars-red-carpet-2024-fashion-looks-photos-1235848118/>noir-hued gowns</a> ruled the <a href=# id=auto-tag_2024-oscars_1 data-tag=2024-oscars>2024 Oscars</a> red carpet. Some were sleek and simple, like the Dolce & Gabbana gown worn by <a href=# id=auto-tag_jamie-lee-curtis_1 data-tag=jamie-lee-curtis>Jamie Lee Curtis</a>, or they brought the drama, with Sandra Hüller’s Schiaparelli and Carey Mulligan’s ivory-accented black mermaid gown by Balenciaga among the best.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Most men, meanwhile, got the memo that a traditional tux was the order of the day for the season’s most prestigious event, which is perhaps why Cillian Murphy opted for a look that felt more conservative than the forward-thinking looks he’s been wearing throughout the awards season. Only a few A-list men once again abandoned thoughts of a tie, including <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/style/ryan-gosling-oscars-red-carpet-2024-look-1235847690/>Ryan Gosling in a custom Gucci suit</a>, subtly accented with crystals and balancing notions of formal and relaxed nicely.

A Bulgari ambassador since 2020, Zendaya paired the gown with pink-gold high jewelry by the Italian house, including <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/style/zendaya-oscars-red-carpet-2024-look-1235847984/>earrings showcasing triangular-cut morganites</a> totaling 42.19 carats.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_rita-moreno_1 data-tag=rita-moreno>Rita Moreno</a> in Badgley Mischka</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rita-Moreno-Oscars-best-dressed-GettyImages-2074074949.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Social media lit up when Rita Moreno was an early arrival on the 2024 <a href=# id=auto-tag_oscars_1 data-tag=oscars>Oscars</a> red carpet. The West Side Story Oscar winner was resplendent in a pleated taffeta and velvet gown from the design duo’s Fall 2024 collection, paired with the opera-length gloves that have become the hot accessory this awards season. Simply put: The 92-year-old Moreno killed it.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Gabrielle Union in Carolina Herrera</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gabrielle-Union-Oscars-best-dressed-GettyImages-2074125047.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The bounty of dramatic black gowns on the <a href=# id=auto-tag_oscars-red-carpet_1 data-tag=oscars-red-carpet>Oscars red carpet</a> worked in Gabrielle Union’s favor, because she stood out beautifully in sparkling Carolina Herrera, a look that was a combination of two dresses Union decided to marry to create a look that was layered and sculptural. She paired her look with Tiffany & Co. jewels, including a platinum necklace that highlighted an aquamarine that exceeded 31 carats, surrounded by diamonds.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Carey Mulligan in Balenciaga</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Carey-Mulligan-Oscars-best-dressed-GettyImages-2074343446.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Maestro best actress nominee channeled old-Hollywood glamour in this custom Balenciaga gown, a re-creation by Demna from a Cristobal Balenciaga design from the couturier’s Winter 1951 collection. The gown was crafted of black velvet that falls to a scalloped fishtail hem that sits atop 150 meters of pleated silk tulle. Mulligan paired the gown with opera-length gloves and Fred Leighton earrings that highlighted old mine-cut diamonds totaling 20 carats.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>America Ferrera in Atelier Versace</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/America-Ferrera-Oscars-best-dressed-GettyImages-2074197529.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">One of the night’s biggest wow moments undeniably belonged to best supporting actress nominee Ferrera, who leaned into Barbie pink with this stunning chainmail dress by Atelier Versace. Several shades of pink were tried before arriving at the perfect hue, while the fit of the gown was nothing less than exceptional. Ferrera completed the look with jewels by Pomellato.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_anya-taylor-joy_1 data-tag=anya-taylor-joy>Anya Taylor-Joy</a> in Dior Haute Couture</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Anya-Taylor-Joy-Oscars-best-dressed-GettyImages-2074200170.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">On the red carpet, presenter and <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/style/dune-2-best-red-carpet-looks-zendaya-timothee-chalamet-1235830892/>Dune: Part Two star</a> Anya Taylor-Joy was thrilled to tell the backstory of her gown, which was inspired by the famed “Venus” gown designed by Christian Dior for his Fall/Winter 1949-1950 haute-couture collection (a copy of the gown currently <a rel=nofollow href=#>resides in the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute</a>). Dior creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri created the modern version, updating the silhouette while paying tribute to the original’s painterly embroidery. Taylor-Joy finished the look with jewels from Tiffany & Co.’s Blue Book collection.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_colman-domingo_1 data-tag=colman-domingo>Colman Domingo</a> in <a href=# id=auto-tag_louis-vuitton_1 data-tag=louis-vuitton>Louis Vuitton</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Colman-Domingo-Oscars-best-dressed-GettyImages-2074161022.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">One of the hottest style stars of the 2024 awards season didn’t disappoint with his Oscar-night look: Colman Domingo’s custom Louis Vuitton suit consisted of a black double-breasted jacket with gold crystal buttons, matching flared pants, a white shirt and a black monogram bowtie with a Louis Vuitton brooch. Domingo’s gold-accented boots were likewise by Louis Vuitton, while his De Ville Prestige watch was by Omega.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Jamie Lee Curtis in Dolce & Gabbana</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jamie-Lee-Curtis-Oscars-best-dressed-GettyImages-2074091823.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Presenter Jamie Lee Curtis mastered the notion of chic simplicity at the 2024 Oscars, choosing this sleek and streamlined silk cady gown by Dolce & Gabbana. Circle back to check out YouTube videos of Curtis on the red carpet, who walked like she knew she looked simply fabulous.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Lupita Nyong’o in Giorgio Armani Privé</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lupita-Nyongo-Oscars-best-dressed-GettyImages-2074228188.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Presenter Lupita Nyong’o was already scoring high marks on the red carpet for her feather-embellished gown in powder blue silk with crystal beading — and then it was revealed that the gown originally was made for Nyong’o to wear to the 2020 Academy Awards, but that year another decision was made. In a moment of sensible haute-couture sustainability, Nyong’o wore the dress this year instead and drew raves from everyone, regardless of this detail. The Oscar-winning actress paired the look with more than 40 carats of De Beers diamond jewelry.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_matt-bomer_1 data-tag=matt-bomer>Matt Bomer</a> in Brunello Cucinelli</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Matt-Bomer-Oscars-best-dressed-GettyImages-2074157842.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Traditional tuxedos were surprisingly abundant, but perhaps no one did ultra-classic style better than Matt Bomer, whose custom Brunello Cucinelli velvet tuxedo jacket actually was not black, but a shade of rich, deep purple, worn with black tuxedo trousers. The Fellow Travelers star finished his look with a TAG Heuer Carrera watch.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Sandra Hüller in Schiaparelli</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sandra-Huller-Oscars-best-dressed-GettyImages-2074185039.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Among the sensational black gowns at the 2024 Oscars, topping the list was Sandra Hüller, a best actress nominee for Anatomy of a Fall. Hüller’s stunning gown was a custom design by Daniel Roseberry for Schiaparelli and was defined by its high-drama off-the-shoulder neckline. The look was finished with Cartier diamonds.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_simu-liu_1 data-tag=simu-liu>Simu Liu</a> in <a href=# id=auto-tag_fendi_1 data-tag=fendi>Fendi</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Simu-Liu-Oscars-best-dressed-GettyImages-2074128224.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Brooches reigned as the most ubiquitous accessory seen on men at the 2024 Oscars, but Barbie‘s Simu Liu elevated this now de rigueur jewel by placing it not on his lapel, but by employing it as the button on his Fendi Men’s black tuxedo, worn over a silver-black tank top. Liu’s diamond brooch was by De Beers, while his watch was by Jacob & Co. He finished the look with Christian Louboutin Alleo black patent-leather boot.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Ariana Grande in Giambattista Valli</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ariana-Grande-Oscars-best-dressed-GettyImages-2066794184.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The star of the upcoming Wicked has worn grand gowns by Giambattista Valli on past red carpets to great effect, and that was equally true of this pink silk confection, a modified look consisting of a ruched strapless gown with train and a voluminous wrap, inspired by the designer’s Fall 2023 haute-couture collection. Grande paired the gown with platinum jewels by Tiffany & Co., including a diamond necklace that highlighted a morganite pendant that exceeded 14 carats.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Cynthia Erivo in Louis Vuitton</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cynthia-Erivo-Oscars-best-dressed-GettyImages-2074358876.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Speaking of Wicked, Grande’s co-star Cynthia Erivo channeled her inner Elphaba in this custom look by Louis Vuitton, with both the gown and its ruffled bolero jacket crafted of emerald green leather. Erivo finished the look with a variety of diamond jewels by Roberto Coin.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Regina King in Atelier Versace</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Regina-King-Oscars-best-dressed-GettyImages-2074263660.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Presenter Regina King likewise stood out in the best way in her boldly hued gown, a custom look by Atelier Versace. From the tangerine silk to the flattering yet subtle beading and high slit, King looked confident and beautiful. The look was finished with jewels by Pomellato and Christian Louboutin’s Degrastress PVC pumps.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Ryan Gosling in Gucci</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ryan-Gosling-Oscars-best-dressed-GettyImages-2074251760.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Before he put on a pink suit and electrified the audience with his showstopping “I’m Just Ken” performance, Ryan Gosling arrived on the red carpet in a suit that was not nearly as bright, but no less dazzling. The black jacket and shirt of Gosling’s custom single-breasted suit by Gucci were both hand-embroidered with metallic trim and paired with matching trousers and patent-leather shoes also by the Italian label. Gosling completed his look with TAG Heuer’s Carrera Plasma Diamant d’Avant-Garde watch — and for anyone wondering, his pink performance suit also was a custom look by Gucci.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Da’Vine Joy Randolph in Louis Vuitton</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Davine-Joy-Randolph-Oscars-best-dressed-GettyImages-2074355694.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The best supporting actress winner for The Holdovers whose acceptance speech was among the night’s most touching, Da’Vine Joy Randolph embraced an unabashed sense of fun and fabulousness on the red carpet with her custom pale blue Louis Vuitton tulle gown, which featured oversized sleeves embellished with fringe. She paired the gown with chandelier high-jewelry diamond earrings by Moussaieff, Omega’s 28mm Constellation watch and Alexandre Birman shoes.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Eva Longoria in Tamara Ralph</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eva-Longoria-Oscars-best-dressed-GettyImages-2074095927.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Flamin’ Hot director wore a sleek and stunning black gown by Tamara Ralph, a sharp silhouette that paired beautifully with her diamond necklace and ring by Bucherer Fine Jewellery. “I wanted something very young and modern and hip,” Longoria said of her jewelry choices on the red carpet.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Kirsten Dunst in Gucci</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Kirsten-Dunst-Oscars-best-dressed-GettyImages-2074190804.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Modernist was undeniably the vibe of Kirsten Dunst’s minimalist silk gown with square neckline, a custom look by Gucci. Antique cushion-cut diamond drop earrings and a ring highlighting an oval-cut fancy light brown diamond, both by Fred Leighton, completed the look.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Ava DuVernay in Louis Vuitton</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ava-duvernay-Oscars-best-dressed-GettyImages-2074308806.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Writer-director Ava DuVernay looked positively regal in a pale blue silk cady crepe gown, a custom look by Louis Vuitton that emphasized her gorgeous shoulders, courtesy of the two wide buckle-like leather straps.
