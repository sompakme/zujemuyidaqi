Michelle</a>'s dreams to become a mother once again, but the&nbsp;All Monsters Are Human singer hasn't had the best of luck. Viewers watched on&nbsp;Love & Hip Hop Hollywood as K. Michelle and her potential surrogate had a massive falling out, but that hasn't hindered her from pressing forward. As the&nbsp;COVID-19 pandemic sweeps the world, causing many people to panic and worry about their health, K. Michelle shared a few thoughts of what it's been like for her as she continues her IVF treatments.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Going through IVF in the midst of the Corona virus, is probably one of the most stressful things I’ve had to deal with," the singer admitted.&nbsp; "By 11pm I will have poked myself in the stomach a total of 8 times today. This is my LAST cycle of IVF." She added that she's only been producing "boy embryos" and is "praying for at least 1 little girl."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">K. Michelle added that her doctor "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">specializes in designer babies</a>" so she and her partner, Dr. Kastan Sims, have the option of choosing their child's gender. "If this doesn’t work I’ll be having two little boys and I’ll be a All boy mom with 3 boys. At this point i’m blessed either way. Some women can’t have kids at all so I won’t complain." She also made it clear that she's choosing to use a surrogate for her mental health, not because she can't carry a child.&nbsp;</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
