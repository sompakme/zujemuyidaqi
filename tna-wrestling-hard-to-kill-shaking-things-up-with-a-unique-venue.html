They are coming back in January with Hard to Kill, and the venue they picked will be an interesting one.</p><p>TNA Wrestling is set to host Hard To Kill on Saturday, January 13, 2024, starting at 4:30 PM. The event will take place at the Pearl Concert Theater, located within the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p><p>This will be a unique venue for pro wrestling, as it usually hosts concerts and other such productions that require a stage. The stage will be there for the show, so we have to wonder if it will be utilized during matches.</p><p>Wrestle Tix reports that, as of the latest available data, there are 676 tickets currently on sale for the event. The current seating arrangement accommodates a total of 1,180 attendees, with 504 tickets already distributed.</p><p>Notably, in the past seven days, an additional 28 tickets have been sold, reflecting ongoing interest in the upcoming wrestling event. We will have to see if they can sell out the venue for the big return of TNA.</p><p>Impact Wrestling changed its name from TNA in 2017. This decision was made to reflect a shift in the branding and identity of the wrestling promotion, with the aim of moving away from the abbreviation “TNA” and emphasizing the name “Impact” as the primary brand name. The change was part of a broader effort to reposition and rebrand the company in the professional wrestling industry. TNA Hard to Kill will be a historic event, and it’s anyone’s guess what they will do</p><p>We will have to see what TNA Wrestling does to spark interest in the months to come.
