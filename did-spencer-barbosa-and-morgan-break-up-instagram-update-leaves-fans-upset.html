She told viewers that the two loved each other very much and that it did not change just because they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>broke up</a>. Spencer stated:</p>“Morgan is my first love. He will always be my first love. He is an amazing, amazing man, and there is no bad blood. We ended on really good terms.”<p>Spencer Barbosa further shared that she received many comments where fans told her that her break up with Morgan caused many to lose faith in love, and they started saying that love does not exist. However, the actress asserted that love exists and that she and Morgan had love.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>TikTok content creator</a> asked her viewers not to think she was okay just because she was sitting in front of the camera with a straight face, looking okay. She affirmed that her talking about the breakup without shedding tears did not mean it did not hurt her or that her heart was not broken.

So it was time for her to follow her own advice.</p><p>In the video's final segment, Spencer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>cried</a> while telling her fans that she loves them very much and that the last few weeks have been very hard for her. She shared that she had been trying really hard to be happy and move on with her life. She also apologized to everyone for not sharing the news with them soon enough.</p><p>Spencer Barbosa and Morgan Penweill started dating in 2021. She shared a photo while holding his hand in December 2021. Spencer posted the picture without revealing her boyfriend’s identity, which piqued the curiosity of her fans.
