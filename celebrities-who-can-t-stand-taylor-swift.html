After the incident, he apologized several times, but Swift insisted on dragging it out.&nbsp;She gave seemingly endless interviews about the feud, eventually telling&nbsp;<a href=#>MTV News</a>&nbsp;that she had accepted West's "very sincere" apology. However, in 2013, <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a> reported that Swift had a framed photo of the iconic 2009 VMA moment in her house. (Kinda weird, right?) Anyway, in 2015, Swift and West&nbsp;<a href=#>hugged it out at the Grammys</a>&nbsp;and embraced again at that year's VMAs, where she <a href=#>presented him</a>&nbsp;with a Video Vanguard Award. Did they bury the hatchet?&nbsp;</p><p>Nope. In February 2016, West dropped his track, "<a href=#>Famous</a>," in which he raps, "I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that b***h famous." West swore Swift approved of the lyrics, but her <a href=#>publicist sang a different tune</a>.&nbsp;Days later, while accepting the Grammy for album of the year, Swift seemed to take a <a href=#>dig</a> at West: "There will be people along the way that will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame," she said.&nbsp;</p><p>This tit for tat is ongoing, with Swift doing what she does best — <a href=#>stirring up drama with song lyrics</a>, and West and his wifey, Kim Kardashian, <a href=#>using their publicity</a> to do the same. Clearly, nobody is shaking it off.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWppZn1wr8SlnJuqmam2pr%2BMnJinrF2owaK6w2armrGcpL9uv9aina1n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
