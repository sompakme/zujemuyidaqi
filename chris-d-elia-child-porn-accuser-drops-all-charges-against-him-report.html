The accuser, using the pseudonym Jane Doe,&nbsp;<a href=# rel>initially claimed that&nbsp;the famed comedian possessed child pornography</a>, and was therefore suing him for child exploitation. Doe has since changed her tune, and has told the court that she is dismissing all claims and charges against him.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The legal document acquired by Radar read, "Plaintiff, Jane Doe, and her counsel hereby give notice that the above-entitled action is voluntarily dismissed, without prejudice, against the Defendant."</span></p><p>Doe originally filed these claims back in March 2021, stating that D’Elia violated federal child pornography and child sexual exploitation laws.

Chris D’Elia abused his status and fame to lure me in, take advantage, and manipulate me when I was at a vulnerable age.”</span></p><p><span>Chris D'Elia took a hiatus from his podcast and social media when the allegations were first surfacing, however he finally returned in February and admitted that sex was controlling his life, which you can check <a href=# rel>here</a>.</span></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">[via]</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdja353gpBmmqGqmah6pbHLophmm5ieuaV5z6ipp2WRmLC2v8SrZJ2qn6XAbq3LpWScoJGntKa%2FjJqemqGeqMFutMimZKudoKS%2FtXnNnq6s</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
