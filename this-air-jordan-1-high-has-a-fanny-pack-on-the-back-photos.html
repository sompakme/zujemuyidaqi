It is one of the most iconic sneakers of all-time, and Jordan Brand has never been afraid to do some interesting and unique things with the silhouette. With their latest <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Air Jordan</a> 1 High, the brand is going in a wild new direction that will certainly be polarizing.

It's a truly bizarre model but one that Jordan Brand clearly put a lot of thought into.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This is definitely an acquired taste as far as sneakers go, however, if you are interested in getting yourself a pair, you will be able to do so as of May 3rd for a price of $175 USD on the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Nike</a> SNKRS App. In the meantime, let us know what you think of these kicks, in the comments below, and stay tuned to HNHH for more news and updates from the sneaker world.</p><p>This Air Jordan 1 High Has A Fanny Pack On The Back: Photos</p><p><h6>Image via Nike</h6><h6></h6></p><p>This Air Jordan 1 High Has A Fanny Pack On The Back: Photos</p><p><h6>Image via Nike</h6><h6></h6></p><p>This Air Jordan 1 High Has A Fanny Pack On The Back: Photos</p><p><h6>Image via Nike</h6><h6></h6></p><p>This Air Jordan 1 High Has A Fanny Pack On The Back: Photos</p><p><h6>Image via Nike</h6><h6></h6></p><p>This Air Jordan 1 High Has A Fanny Pack On The Back: Photos</p><p><h6>Image via Nike</h6><br></p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
