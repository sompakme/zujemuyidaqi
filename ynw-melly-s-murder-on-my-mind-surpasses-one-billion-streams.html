For <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>YNW Melly</a>, the fact that he was charged with the murder of two young men, both of whom were thought to be his friends, had a strangely beneficial effect on his music career. Since then, fans have been flocking to his single "Murder On My Mind," a track many have since rationalized to be a precursor to his violent actions.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">And by many, that's an italicized&nbsp;many.&nbsp;Our Generation Music has since reported that "Murder On My Mind" has surpassed a total of one billion streams.

An interesting character study, to be sure, but one has to wonder where art ends and real-life begins -- it's a line often&nbsp;moved by those seeking to prosecute rappers, and a slippery slope at that. Are you one of the billion people who gravitated toward Melly's macabre musings of murder?&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdia4F2gZJmsKevXaKyrbjYrGSmraKZsrN5zqdkprFdoravsIysrKuokajApr%2BMqKWeZZKeua21zqdkrKyimq6uv4ynnLCr</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
