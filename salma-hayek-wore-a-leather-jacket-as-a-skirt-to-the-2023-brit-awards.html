Typically defined by roomy leather jackets and biker boots, the motorsport aesthetic isn't exactly sexy, but when it comes to Hayek, anything is possible.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Saturday, the actress attended the 2023 BRIT Awards and showed up on the red carpet in a head-to-toe leather look. On top, she wore a black leather corset with sheer paneling and a peplum waist, and on bottom, she made a deconstructed motorcycle jacket work as a skirt. She wore the coat wrapped around her waist with the collar and lapels creating an asymmetric high-slit on one side, and the back of the jacket covering the opposite end of her body. She paired the makeshift skirt with fishnet tights and lace-up combat boots that featured a chunky platform heel.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Adding her signature touch of glam, Salma accessorized with a knot-shaped necklace covered in pavé diamonds, as well as a smattering of sparkling rings. Her hair was worn down in crimped curls with a middle part, and she combined a sultry smoky eye with rosy cheeks and pink lips.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Salma was joined by her husband, French billionaire François-Henri Pinault, at last night's award show — days after she revealed she didn't know she was getting married the day of their wedding. "I had a phobia of the marriage thing," Hayek told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Glamour</a>. "I didn't even know I was getting married that day. It was like an intervention. They just took me to the court. My parents, my brother, they were all ganging up on me." Hayek and Pinault married on Valentine's Day in 2009, two years after they welcomed their daughter Valentina.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, "The reason why it was a courthouse wedding was because they dragged me there. I was nervous. And then after, there was a lunch at his parents' house. My mother-in-law, who's the most tasteful person when it comes to entertaining, had already been doing the lunch. I had no choice."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570pqjppldna66scpmo56ZpJ2ys3nJmpqknaRiwKy10a1ka2hiaHqjvsitZJqvkaextHmWamdxbmdt</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
