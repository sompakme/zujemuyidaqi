The show, which lasted six seasons, was ahead of its time too, when it aired a passionate kiss between two men, played by Kerr Smith and Adam Kaufman, for the first time ever on primetime TV, per <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>. The show also turned its main actors, including Katie Holmes, into instant stars. Shockingly, Holmes almost never had a chance to play Joey Potter because she wasn't the first choice for the role. <a href=#>Selma Blair</a>, who became famous with the 1999 film "Cruel Intentions," was the original plan to portray Joey. "I really loved Selma until, of course, I got the infamous videotape from the basement of the Holmes family in Toledo, Ohio," show creator Kevin Williamson told <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>. "And when that video showed up, it changed my whole life," he added. He was referring to Holmes' audition tape that she made with the help of her mom, per&nbsp;<a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>.</p><p>Even decades after other acting roles, Holmes' connection to "Dawson's Creek" continues to stick with her. "I don't know if I have moved past it, but I don't really care," Holmes told <a href=#>Elle</a> about the teen drama. "I had a ball doing it, and it's really nice to be a part of something that did affect people. And it created a lot of opportunities for all of us. You can't really ask for much more than that," she added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmlmZ310e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5ypqrop1dnbytucSsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
