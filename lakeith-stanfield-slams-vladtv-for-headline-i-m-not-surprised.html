LaKeith Stanfield is a rising, celebrated actor of our time, and often his comments steal attention from the public. Last week, Standfield's interview with&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter was published, and inside, he spoke with the outlet about his high school days as a theater kid. He&nbsp;thrived during that time, bonding with the "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">oddballs of the theater scene</a>," as&nbsp;THR described them. Stanfield noted that it wasn't controversial to see love scenes between two men, and he said that he "always wanted to play a gay role. Because I wanted to experience and feel and understand what that meant."</p><p>Rich Polk / Stringer / Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While Stanfield was speaking on expanding his views artistically, the quote soon made headlines.&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">VladTV&nbsp;made a post</a> about it titled "LaKeith Stanfield Says He Wants to Play Gay Role to 'Feel What That Meant,'" and it didn't take long for the commentary to roll in. In a post-and-delete move, Standfield criticized the publication for allegedly playing on people's phobias.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Yes i was saying i wanted to experience love through a lense i hadn't experienced before though a character," LaKeith explained. "After all, love is love, OF COURSE Vladtv strikes again trying to make that fact a dramatic and negative thing.<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> I'm not surprised</a>. I'm a Black man and he's Vlad. Out of all the things i said in the interview with THR you chose to zoom in on this and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">try to frame me in a way </a>where your fans can hate on me, you ain't slick."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The actor concluded, "Too bad most ppl aren't deeply bigoted and so don't care to grab your bait."
