He's had a pretty eventful year filled with ups and downs. A few days back, he announced&nbsp;.38 Baby 2 would be coming soon and dropped the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">first single off</a>&nbsp;of it. However, it seems that before we receive that he'll be dropping another mixtape,&nbsp;Broken Hearted.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">YoungBoy NBA has been releasing new music and making headlines on the regular, it's almost impossible to not see his name pop-up in the hip hop community. It seems that he plans on keeping it that way because the new mixtape&nbsp;will be dropping on September 20th. His producer, Dubba-AA&nbsp;teased the project earlier in the day on Instagram. He posted a picture of himself, with YoungBoy and DJ Swift, the caption read "While y'all sleep we still workin!&nbsp;@nba_youngboy&nbsp;x&nbsp;@dubbaaa&nbsp;x&nbsp;@djswift_813&nbsp;we gotta big announcement for all the day ones&nbsp;#NBAYoungBoy#DubbaAA&nbsp;#DjSwift" Then followed it with the announced the album art and release date for&nbsp;Broken Hearted.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This comes nearly a month and a half after his breakthrough,&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">AI YoungBoy</a>, dropped. The mixtape alone has been making some very serious waves and progressing his career. Songs like "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">No Smoke</a>" &nbsp;has helped him garner the attention of many rappers and fans for it's infectious hook and rawness. Even Bay Area OG, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>E-40</a>, has recently nabbed him for a feature on "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Straight Out The Dirt</a>" with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Yo Gotti</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While he clearly has a lot of music that's ready to be released, he's been facing some set-backs recently as well. The Baton Rouge rapper was recently&nbsp;given a suspended sentence of ten years, three years of probation, 250 hours of community service & a $5000 dollar fine for his <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">involvement in a drive-by shooting</a>. With so much going on in the rapper's life, he seems to be pretty committed to setting himself on the right path. Clearly so, since he's been putting in a lot of work in the studio and enough for two projects that are on the go.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">With Broken Hearted&nbsp;on the way, we'll definitely be anticipating that as well as the release of&nbsp;.38 Baby 2.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Check the Instagram posts below:</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
