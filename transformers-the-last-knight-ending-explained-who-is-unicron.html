With the movie now in theaters, audiences have an answer to that question … kind of.</p><p>Turns out, <span data-scayt_word=Unicron data-scaytid=2>Unicron</span> wasn’t just in The Last Knight, but has actually been in the entire series to date … because <span data-scayt_word=Unicron data-scaytid=4>Unicron</span> is the Transformers’ name for Earth. You could be forgiven for wondering why this was never mentioned in any of the four previous installments of the series, if it wasn’t for the fact that this was obviously a new invention for this movie, and something that either lays the groundwork for a surprising reveal in a future movie, or rewrites Transformers mythology significantly.</p><p>Traditionally, <span data-scayt_word=Unicron data-scaytid=6>Unicron</span> not only isn’t Earth, but it’s not actually a planet at all. Instead, the concept, first introduced in 1986’s animated Transformers: The Movie, was something that originally looked like a planet, but turned out to be a massive Transformer himself. The exact <span data-scayt_word=backstory data-scaytid=9>backstory</span> of <span data-scayt_word=Unicron data-scaytid=8>Unicron</span> in multiple versions of Transformers mythology has often shifted — is he a cosmic force representing evil itself, created at the dawn of time, or an equal-and-opposite counterpart to Primus, the creator of all Transformers, birthed by a God-like being called “The One”? Depending on whether you watched specific cartoons or read particular comics, the answer to both could be “yes” — but his modus operandi has always been the same: He’s the most giant of all the robots, who sometimes turns into something that looks like a planet, and intends to destroy all the Transformers. He is, for want of a better way to put it, the ultimate bad guy.</p><p>In The Last Knight, though, that would appear not to be the case; in the cinematic mythology, <span data-scayt_word=Unicron data-scaytid=12>Unicron</span> is the name given to the ancient enemy of <span data-scayt_word=Cybertron data-scaytid=14>Cybertron</span>, the Transformers’ home world … which just so happens to be Earth.</p><p>That brings with it all kinds of questions. (Does this explain why the Transformers came to Earth in the first place? What about the Creators, and “<span data-scayt_word=Transformium data-scaytid=15>Transformium</span>,” the alloy that was planted on Earth millennia in the past; was Earth created specifically to be a trap for Transformers? And, for that matter, how can a planet be an ancient enemy of anyone or anything? It’s a planet.) It also, apparently, means that the movie <span data-scayt_word=Unicron data-scaytid=16>Unicron</span> is very different from the <span data-scayt_word=Unicron data-scaytid=17>Unicron</span> of all other Transformers stories. Perhaps.</p><p>There is, after all, a post-credit scene that suggests that <span data-scayt_word=Unicron data-scaytid=20>Unicron</span>/Earth isn’t exactly what everyone thinks after all. When <span data-scayt_word=Quintessa data-scaytid=22>Quintessa</span> shows up, she even says that “he” doesn’t like to be touched, when referring to one of the new structures that appeared on Earth during the movie.</p><p>Add two more questions to the Last Knight‘s <span data-scayt_word=Unicron data-scaytid=23>Unicron</span> reveal, in that case — one that isn’t likely to be answered until Transformers 6, whenever that happens: Is Earth not actually a planet at all, but instead a giant robot in disguise? And if so, what exactly does that mean for all the life on Earth, should <span data-scayt_word=Unicron data-scaytid=25>Unicron</span> decide to transform?</p><p>As cliffhangers go, it’s certainly more than meets the eye.
