Although she‚Äôs built her life in the modern metropolis, Kattan was reportedly born in Oklahoma, USA, to Iraqi parents. Her family relocated to the UAE in 2003, along with her sisters Huda and Alya.</p><p>Kattan graduated with a finance degree from the American University of Sharjah in 2008 and went on to work as a financial analyst before joining forces with her sisters, Huda and Alya, in 2013 to co-found Huda Beauty. Mona claims the beauty brand was valued at $1.2 billion within four years. Forbes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">estimates</a> their 2020 annual sales hit $250 million.</p><p>The makeup mogul branched out into her own venture in 2017: Kayali Fragrances.

Nowell-Barnes is the founder and CEO of Dubai-based streetwear brand The Giving Movement. Originally from Leeds, UK, he had moved to Dubai just two years before meeting Mona and he converted to Islam early in the relationship after meeting on Tinder.</p><p>The couple were engaged in April 2019 but quietly separated in late 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfqLWww9JopKimkWK4osDTmqVmoaNiuqq4y6Kmp6tdlrWmrcNmpp9lmJq%2FbrDUm5iiZZKhtq%2BzjJyYrKxdorKursSrqmaclai9qsDEZqqipZmhrrN5wKCcrA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
