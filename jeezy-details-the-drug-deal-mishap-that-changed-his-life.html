That came through an appearance on Mavericks where he told a story about a time he was manipulated. “My loyalty got me in a lot of trouble. I was going to make this play with my older cousin. He was like, ‘These my people.’ I was like, ‘Let me bring my strap.’ He was like, ‘Nah, you good.’ But it’s big cuz — you trust him like, ‘Iight cool," his story begins.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">He expands on how quickly things fell apart. “We meet these guys in a semi-trailer truck. I give him the money and he gives me this laundry bag, and this laundry bag has the work in it but it’s covered in a blanket. I get back to the house, me and my man start to cut this sh*t open… and it’s sheetrock. This is&nbsp;all&nbsp;my money. I’m broke! I was more hurt than anything because I felt like I had so much respect and admiration for [my cousin].” He concluded the story by explaining how he believed his cousin was in on it the whole time and how it changed him. “So that turned me into a whole ‘nother animal. At first, I wasn’t really thugging; I’m just hustling. Now, I’m thugging.” Check out the full clip below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-jeezy-s-lesson-learned>Jeezy's Lesson Learned</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier today, Jeezy took to Instagram to make a major announcement.
