While he enjoyed a solid run in NXT, becoming one of the brand’s top stars thanks to his captivating character and impressive in-ring skills, he also faced a whirlwind of controversy,<a href=#>&nbsp;including allegations that sent the hashtag #FireVelveteenDream trending</a>&nbsp;whenever he appeared on television. Dream has now issued an apology to kick off 2024 in the right way.</p><p><a href=#>The storm of allegations resulted in his release from WWE in 2021</a>, concluding a chapter marked by negative headlines. Despite the challenges, Velveteen Dream is considering turning the page and embarking on a new chapter in his wrestling journey and perhaps just life in general.</p><p>Back in 2022,&nbsp;the battery and trespassing case against Velveteen Dream was closed, and he embarked on a personal journey of rehabilitation. It was reported that Dream has been&nbsp;<a href=#>making significant progress during his time in rehab</a>, focusing on personal growth and improvement.</p><p>It’s worth noting that&nbsp;<a href=#>Velveteen Dream was quietly suspended by WWE</a>&nbsp;for alleged cocaine consumption during his time with the company. Dream’s behavior also earned him a reputation as a “public relations nightmare” before his eventual release.</p><p>In a heartfelt gesture, the former WWE Superstar took to his Instagram at the beginning of earlier this morning, <a href=#>uploading video in which he extended a sincere apology for his actions</a> and behavior over the past few years.</p><p>”As you’ve probably seen or heard over the course of the last few years, I wanna apologize for my behavior. Both professionally and personally I always preach to those close to me about the power of accountability and responsibility, I take full accountability for my behavior over the last three years of my life. When narratives were written about me, it doesn’t matter. It didn’t matter what was written about me, it doesn’t matter what’s on the internet about me. I was wrong. Because of that, I need to apologize to a few people.“</p><p>First I wanna apologize to the WWE organization for any unwanted attention and negative press that I brought to your brand and product. I wanna apologize to the WWE fans and Velveteen Dream fans. Because when you speak about Velveteen Dream, it should have been spoken about in a productive and positive light. Not the name Patrick Clark as a statistic of what happens when talent and opportunity meet immaturity. That’s not what you invest your time and money in. When you look on the TV and come to the shows, you should escape reality, not have to deal with mine.</p><p>“I wanna apologize to Paul Levesque. Paul, you are such an understanding and patient man and leader and getting the opportunity to work with you and learn from you, I get the sense of what makes you who you are and how you’ve been able to handle the responsibility of being in the public light. I want to apologize to you, Paul, I’m sorry. Also want to say I’m sorry to Shawn Michaels. Shawn, it’s still beyond me that I’ve been having the opportunity in this lifetime to learn from you, and to have your mentorship and guidance. And I apologize if you feel like you’ve wasted your time and your energy, investing into me. You have not. I’m still a work in progress. I’m still learning. And I remember all the lessons that you’ve taught me. Shawn, I’m sorry.” He also apologized to his best friend.”</p><p>“I want to apologize to my family: my mom, my dad, my brother, my sister, my nieces and my nephews. Because you may read things, you may hear about things, you may be confronted by people who you don’t know. And you might feel the need to explain yourselves on my behalf. I just want you to know that you do not have to do that ever. No one should have to explain anything for Patrick Clark. No one should have to trend because of Patrick Clark. No one should have to ask, you know, to answer the questions. ‘Where is Patrick now? What did Patrick do? What happened with Patrick?’ That’s not your responsibility. And I don’t want you to feel burdened with that responsibility. That’s my responsibility, okay? And I apologize to you all for any energy. Negative energy that has had to come your way because of me. Okay. Again, I want to apologize to the fans and those in my professional and personal life that I’ve affected by my behavior. I’m sorry. I recognize that I was losing myself, and I apologize to anyone that I lost along the way. Anyone that I’ve upset or offended because of my behavior. Man, I’m sorry, and I hope you all forgive me. Thank you.”</p><p>Velveteen Dream’s decision to take accountability for his actions is a commendable step forward. It demonstrates a willingness to confront past mistakes and work towards personal growth and redemption. As the former WWE Superstar moves forward, we eagerly anticipate what the future has in store for him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What do you think of what The Velveteen Dream had to say?
