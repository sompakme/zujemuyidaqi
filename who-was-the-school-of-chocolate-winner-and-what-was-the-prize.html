He claimed the victory with his remarkable prehistoric showpiece, which featured vibrant delicate blooms and a towering dinosaur head.</p><p>Hailing from Cartago, Colombia, Juan Gutierrez serves as the pastry chef at Four Seasons Chicago’s Adorn Bar and Restaurant. Before taking on this role, he led the pastry kitchen at Virgin Hotels Chicago. His culinary journey began against the wishes of his family, who initially encouraged him to pursue a career in medicine. However, at the age of 19, he made the decision to relocate to Chicago to attend the French Pastry School and also holds a degree from Mariano Moreno Culinary Institute. His dedication paid off, and he became the executive pastry chef at Longman & Eagle at the young age of 24. Additionally, he received a nomination for the prestigious Jean Banchet Award for Rising Star Pastry Chef Of The Year.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Juan Gutierrez’s victory in “School Of Chocolate” comes with a grand prize valued at $100,000.
