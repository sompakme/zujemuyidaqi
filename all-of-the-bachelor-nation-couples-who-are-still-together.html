They married in 2010, a year after their season aired. Mesnick, who made history on the show as the first Bachelor to be a single dad, had a second child with Molly, named Riley, after his first child, Tyler.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.4704595185996><h2>Ann Leuders and Jesse Csincsak</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-104800964-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Jesse Csincsak’s engagement to season four Bachelorette DeAnna Pappas didn’t last, but he was able to find love through Bachelor Nation anyway — just not onscreen. He met season 13 contestant Ann Lueders in 2010 and married the same year, while Lueders was four months pregnant with their first child, Noah. Since then, they had two more children: Charlotte and Carter.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-0.48793565683646><h2>Peyton Wright and Chris Lambton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-144358094-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Peyton Wright and Chris Lambton were both runner-ups in their respective seasons of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, but found love offscreen after being introduced by Bachelor Nation friends in 2010.

After vying for Matt Grant in season 12 of The Bachelor didn’t work out, Holly Durst got engaged to Michael Stagliano, who appeared in Jillian Harris’ season of The Bachelorette. They broke up shortly afterwards. Though they competed in — and won — Bachelor Pad’s second season, Holly found love with another contestant: Blake Julian from Ashley Hebert’s season of The Bachelorette.

The former Denver Broncos quarterback initially showed interest in other women, not having his first one-on-one date with Catherine until episode six, but that time together helped Catherine turn into a frontrunner throughout the rest of the season. The couple got married in 2014, nearly a year after their season aired. They share three children: Samuel, Isaiah, and Mia. Sean and Catherine regularly make appearances in Bachelor Nation shows, giving advice on how to make the most of their time in the villa.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9621052631579><h2>Desiree Hartsock and Chris Siegfried</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1024943450-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When she had picked her final three men, Desiree Hartsock made it seem like Brooks Forester was her first choice, as she could easily picture a future with him.

A pair that ended up hitting it off during that time was Raven Gates and Adam Gottschalk, who realized they were a good match after a night out at a bar in Dallas. Though they didn’t get engaged on the show, they established themselves as a couple and got engaged two years later in 2019 and married in 2021.
