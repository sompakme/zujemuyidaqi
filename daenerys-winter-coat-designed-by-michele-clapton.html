But taking Daenerys's look in a new direction was a big step for the show, costume designer Michele Clapton tells HarpersBAZAAR.com. "They were nervous it would be too much of a statement," she says of showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. "They were like, ‘White? You think that’s gonna work?’ and I was like, ‘Yes, it’s really, really, really gonna work.'"</p><img alt="Sleeve, " title="Sleeve, " width=1203 height=802 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-dany-winter-outfit-1-1503327204.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">HBO</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Clapton was right, of course—<a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a12041342/game-of-thrones-daenerys-winter-outfit/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="fans on Twitter" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">fans on Twitter</a> dubbed Dany an "ice queen" and claimed the look "stole the entire episode." The designer admits it was meant to indicate a turning point in the young queen's life. "I can’t think of another time she’s gone to the aid of someone who is also, to some extent, a rival," Clapton says, hinting at Dany's burgeoning relationship with Jon Snow. "It had to be a real statement piece. It looks very warrior queen—she’s a vision when Jon looks up and sees her arriving."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though the faux coat easily looks like couture, its inspiration came from an unexpected, practical source: the Wildlings, who famously camouflaged themselves to blend in with their surroundings north of the Wall. "I liked the idea of her being at one with the snow and the rocks," Clapton says. This could, of course, also demonstrate Daenerys's willingness to ally herself with Jon, who spent his entire life amongst the snow of Winterfell and later, the Wall. It also makes for an interesting contrast when Dany sits next to Jon's men, who all wore Wildling garb to venture North, after pulling them to safety on Drogon's back. It's a moment which quickly turns cruel, though, as they watch Viserion fall to his death.</p><img alt="People, Human, Beard, Movie, Facial hair, Screenshot, Adaptation, Photography, Fictional character, " title="People, Human, Beard, Movie, Facial hair, Screenshot, Adaptation, Photography, Fictional character, " width=1000 height=500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-dany-embed-copy-1503591920.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">HBO</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But now it's time to look to the future, and with a romance between Jon and Daenerys <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a12062411/jon-snow-daenerys-targaryen-romance-alan-taylor-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="all but confirmed" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">all but confirmed</a>, we can't wait to see how their relationship inspires Clapton next—particularly when it comes to wedding gowns.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/06c47b5e-d8a7-4a36-a55b-cc6f88763ba6_1566915614.jpg alt="Headshot of Julie Kosin" title="Headshot of Julie Kosin" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Julie Kosin is the senior culture editor of ELLE.com, where she oversees all things movies, TV, books, music, and art, from trawling Netflix for a worthy binge to endorsing your next book club pick.
