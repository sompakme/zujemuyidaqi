On 21 January, the sweet little boy celebrated his fourth birthday, and his proud mum Briana Jungwirth took to Instagram to share a rare snapshot in honour of the occasion. The picture shows Freddie sitting at a table ready to blow out the candle on his birthday cupcake. Wearing a 'Happy Birthday' badge and with a smart side-parting, he looks angelic as he smiles up at the camera â€“ and fans were quick to comment on the similarities between father and son. "Literally, a little Louis," one commented, while another remarked: "So cute! Looks just like his dad!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5241184cc02e-louis-tomlinson-son-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eyZXfHBgMynE data-wc=9><strong>Louis Tomlinson's son Freddie recently celebrated his fourth birthday</strong></p><p id=eV4IJSV4LN-O data-wc=116>Louis, 28, and Briana welcomed Freddie in 2016; they have since gone their separate ways but remain devoted parents to their son. Freddie lives in the US with his mum, but spends time with his dad on a regular basis. Speaking previously about his relationship with Freddie, Louis told the : "When I look back to baby photos of myself and he does look very similar it's real nice. And he's at a good age at the moment so it's really fun! Any time he can do something new - for example, [when] he just started taking his first few steps, which is like nothing else. It's constantly changing, but the whole thing is super cool."</p><p id=eXoJGwtmsMRi data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Jacqueline Jossa shares dramatic photo showing birth of eldest daughter Ella</a></strong></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p style=text-align:center id=ejowHQ9u6NeC data-wc=8><strong>Robbie Williams reveals daughter is destined for showbiz</strong></p><p id=eDv4pVd_m1KG data-wc=64>Louis tends to keep his son away from social media, but in 2016 he shared a sweet post in honour of his first Father's Day.
