The video began with the reality star showing the makeup palette that was used.</p><p>It seems like North made use of four different color palettes to complete the look.

A couple of months ago Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, had raised his concerns over North using social media as he did not want their daughter to be on the platform at this age.</p><p>However, Kim was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">quick to respond</a> to this. The reality star noted that North was allowed to express her creative side with adult supervision. Kim further added that she wanted their daughter to be happy and was doing everything she could as the main caregiver.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH THE KARDASHIANS ON HULU FROM THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 22ND<br><strong>AND&nbsp;GET FREAKY WITH US ON&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">INSTAGRAM</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FACEBOOK</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TWITTER</a>&nbsp;AND&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TIKTOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xXaOyuL%2BOp6arrJhixKa%2F02aqoaenqHqwssVmn56qXaKurLHUqWSso5mhubR5wKxkrKCVYsGzrc2snaiqnah6rsHMZqKipV2eu7W7jKagp6Gfow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
