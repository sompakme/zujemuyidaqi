Due to their popularity on the show, they now have their own spin-off show, where viewers can watch their new journey as a family of four.</p><p>Loren received the news that every pregnant woman dreads during last night’s episode of <a href=#>Loren & Alexei: After the 90</a> <a href=#>Days</a>, that her baby boy will have to spend time in the NICU after birth. With TLC viewers worrying and hoping that Loren and baby number 2 are okay, Reality Titbit has explored how the birth went, and how he is doing today.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure>BridTV4595Darcey & Stacey | First Look Season 2854400854400center22403<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-loren-was-told-her-baby-could-spend-4-weeks-in-nicu>Loren was told her baby could spend 4 weeks in NICU</h2><p>Loren and Alexei welcomed their second son into the world on Monday the 16th of August 2021, and they named him Asher Noah Brovarnik.</p><p>However, whilst she was 32-weeks pregnant she visited the doctor as she was experiencing sharp pains down her back and her lower stomach, which she described as a “9 on a pain scale”.</p><p>She was told by the doctor that her baby is pushing her cervix with their legs. This was dangerous for Loren, as she had a cervical cerclage a few years ago, and if the baby pushed too hard then they could break the cerclage and come out.</p><p>The doctor said that if her baby came this early, they would have to spend at least four weeks in the NICU. This scared Loren, as she said she’s “not ready for that, that’s not how it’s supposed to go.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Loren Brovarnik (@lorenbrovarnik)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-asher-was-born-happy-and-healthy>Asher was born happy and healthy</h2><p>Despite concerns from doctors due to being premature, Asher was born healthy and there were no major complications.</p><p>Loren announced his birth on her Instagram saying: “Due to some circumstances, he is in the NICU, but recovering well.
