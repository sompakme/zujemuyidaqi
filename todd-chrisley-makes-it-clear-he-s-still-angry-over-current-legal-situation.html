Per <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, the couple has vowed to appeal, but they're potentially looking at a long stretch behind bars.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=#>Todd's embroiled in an entirely new legal battle</a>. The "Chrisley Knows Best" star is being sued for defamation. <a href=#>Page Six</a> reports Amy Doherty-Heinze, a former Georgia Department of Revenue investigator, alleges Todd "falsely and maliciously" talked smack about her during his <a href=#>"Chrisley Confessions"</a> podcast. Todd appeared on his daughter's podcast, <a href=#>"Unlocked with Savannah Chrisley,"</a> to discuss his feelings about the trial and allegations. Savannah noted her dad reacted with fury and indignation towards his legal tribulations, just as she did.</p><p>In contrast, her mom's been a lot more zen. "At the beginning, and really up until the past few months, you had that anger towards the situation that I'm experiencing. And so, what did that feel like?" Savannah asked in an episode called <a href=#>"The Todd Father."</a> The reality star explained that his feelings were fueled by disbelief that he and Julie had landed in such circumstances. Despite their guilty verdict, Todd had believed "God would allow" the court to see "all of this evidence" that proved their innocence. "I think that my anger grew from that," he admitted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhpZ391fY6tpp2cXZi1s7XSpZyyZZ2WuKa%2FjKKrZpucmq6zedOhmK1lmJrAbr%2FToqOlZZGjtLPFjKitnqpdmMKzvsSnq2aklZyurXnSoquumaSevK97</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
