Those surprisingly down-to-earth moments are interspersed between shots of Chiu attending dazzling parties and trying on jaw-dropping works of high fashion, making her one of the most fascinating characters on the show. Here's everything you need to know about Chiu, from her many philanthropic efforts to that time she almost joined another very over-the-top reality show.</p><h2 id=she-apos-s-an-extremely-active-philanthropist-and-businesswoman-3>She's an extremely active philanthropist and businesswoman.</h2><p>Chiu, who was born in Taiwan, graduated from Pepperdine University with a degree in international business and initially began working in PR in the beauty industry. Now, she uses her business acumen as a managing partner for her husband's luxury medispa in Beverly Hills, which counts plenty of celebrities and Hollywood bigwigs among its clients.</p><p>In a 2016&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/beverly-hills-housewife-annoyed-at-931205 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>interview</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter, Chiu shared that she's figured out how to combine her love of haute couture with her day job: by forecasting plastic surgery trends based on the styles heading down the runway. That year, for example, Chiu reportedly noted that the renewed focus on the shoulders, neck, and décolletage would likely result in increased requests for procedures to hide wrinkles and sun damage in those areas.</p><p>Beyond her efforts to expand the Chiu family's plastic surgery empire, Chiu also dedicates much of her time to philanthropy. According to her&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://chiureviewsscholarship.com/sponsor/8/christine_chiu.php referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>bio</a>&nbsp;on the website for a scholarship the Chius award each year, she has served on the boards of an impressive number of charitable organizations, including the L.A. County Museum of Art's Costume Council, UNICEF Chinese Children's Initiative, and Step Up Woman's Network. The Chius further support even more organizations, from St. Judes Children's Research Hospital to the L.A. Philharmonic.</p><p>On top of all of this, in 2019, Chiu and her husband teamed up with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-charles/>Prince Charles</a> to&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/la-philanthropists-open-health-wellness-center-1180146 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>open</a>&nbsp;the Prince's Foundation Chiu Integrated Health Programme in Cumnock, Scotland, to provide holistic healthcare services to locals.</p><h2 id=she-almost-became-a-xa0-real-housewife-3>She almost became a&nbsp;Real Housewife.</h2><p>Back in 2014, the&nbsp;Daily Mail&nbsp;published&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2650915/New-RHOBH-castmember-Christine-Chiu-films-scenes-Brandi-Glanville-following-season-five-cast-shake-up.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>photos</a>&nbsp;that appeared to show Chiu shopping and dining with&nbsp;The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&nbsp;cast member Brandi Glanville in full view of Bravo's camera crew.&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2014/06/christine-chiu-rhobh-third-season-testing-bravo/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Reports</a>&nbsp;at the time confirmed that Chiu was "definitely in the running" to join&nbsp;RHOBH&nbsp;as a full-time cast member, and that she had been considered to join the show multiple times before.

I mean, who&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;wear Dolce & Gabbana couture and dress their toddler in a tiny Gucci suit on Thanksgiving?</p><p>She's also spoken often about her very precise approach to shopping the runways. "The first process of elimination is if it overlaps with any other pieces I'm potentially buying. Then it's the price. If it's an insane price (like a seven-figure range), I consider whether I would rather get three dresses or one spectacular dress," Chiu&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/a29310251/christine-chiu-inside-haute-couture/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>told</a>&nbsp;Harper's Bazaar&nbsp;in 2019, though she added that she doesn't typically have a budget.</p><p>Beyond that, she continued, "I think about how much the material costs, how hard it is to make, the effort that has gone into it. Everyone has their own evaluation." Still, she added, "Sometimes there's no logical reason behind it, you just fall in love and the price doesn't matter."</p><p>In her 2016 interview with&nbsp;THR, Chiu admitted that another major consideration comes from whether a designer intends to dress anyone else in a piece she has her eye on. "The first five years of couture for me were about coming to terms with celebrities possibly wearing the same dress that I'm paying a lot of money for," she said at the time. "A few years ago, there was a Chanel dress that I was putting a deposit on, and I saw Jessica Chastain wearing it at an Oscar event and thought, 'I don't want the sloppy seconds.' Not that anyone would call couture sloppy."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRomGxtYmeFen%2BQaK6hp12ewG6vx6ugrKyZo7Jur8eirGaanJ67qHnEpqeiqpVk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
