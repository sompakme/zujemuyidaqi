"You know what I mean? I didn't grow up in a house where we had shame about being naked, ever. I didn't think I was posting that crazy of things even for me—I know I can be a little escándalo."</p><p>The House Bunny actress added that many commenters object to her breastfeeding pics because they deem them as "private."</p><p>She said, "I'm like, 'Really? How would you feel if I told you to lock yourself in a little cubicle at the airport when you wanted to eat?' I'm feeding my kid. It's not sexual unless you're making it that way."</p><p>Willis spoke to People as she participates in Cleobella's "Do It Like a Mother" campaign, which celebrates motherhood in all its iterations.</p><p>In a promotional video for the campaign, Willis said, "I do it like a mother with strength, courage, liberation, love, and compassion."</p><p>The campaign is a beautiful fit for Willis, who believes wholeheartedly in <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/rumer-willis-sexier-than-ever-mothers-day/>supporting mothers</a> throughout their journey of raising children.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

"So I think, for me, what's so important, especially coming up to Mother's Day, is I want to create a more intentional community for women to be able to share their experiences, share their choices."</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/rumer-willis-bruce-first-grandchild/>Willis shares Louetta</a> with boyfriend Derek Richard Thomas, and is part of the close-knit Willis family.
