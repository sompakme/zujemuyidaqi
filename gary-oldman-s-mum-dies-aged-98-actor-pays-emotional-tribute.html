Kathleen, who was also mum to actress Laila Morse - real name Maureen Bass, was described by her son as a "woman of great talent and mirth" in an emotional tribute posted on Gary's joint Instagram account with his wife Gisele Schmidt. "It is with a heavy heart that we announce the passing of Kay Oldman, Mother of Gary Oldman, Jacqueline Wyles, and Maureen Lesley Bass," it read. "Kay was a woman of great talent and mirth, keeping her loved ones smiling with her quick wit and ready repartee until the end. For her family and friends she was a source of warmth, inspiration, amusement, support and she will be deeply missed."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/461394cc2eed-gary-oldman-mum-dies-aged-98-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eCukJCJpV4ba data-wc=12><strong>Gary Oldman's mum Kathleen has passed away at the age of 98</strong></p><p id=ekU5NirX1gqC><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: Gary Oldman shares sweet message for his mum as he accepts Best Actor award at the Oscars</a></p><p id=eq1LSePsPDOy data-wc=118>The post continued: "We were very fortunate to have her in our lives and were given time to say goodbye. The past few days have been heartbreaking but also filled with love, laughter, and celebration of a life fully lived. We mourn and grieve but loved ones never leave us as long as we keep their memories with us. Kay touched so many of us, so she goes on in our thoughts and in our hearts! The family requests privacy in their time of mourning and we thank you for the outpouring of love on her and our behalf." Accompanying the tribute were two black-and-white photos of Katheen, one as a young woman and one taken more recently.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/79f74a52b957-gary-oldman-mum-dies-tribute-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e69GFwpGS5Ug data-wc=16><strong>The actor shared a beautiful photo of his mum as a young woman in his tribute</strong></p><p id=eZYIVQW-Sn0A data-wc=77>Kathleen – who was affectionately known as Kay – often featured on her son's social media posts, including a lovely photo of the pair taken in May where they celebrated Mother's Day in the USA.
