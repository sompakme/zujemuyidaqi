Cast in the main role of Carol Martin, and starring opposite David Selby and Lisa Eilbacher, Annette rocked a completely different look for the film, and she looks incredible.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a97bfc85989d-annette-otoole-love-for-rent-character.jpg><p id=ezXgNCMrqNp data-wc=53>While Annette was typically recognized as a brunette, the actress sported rich red locks for the flick, and she's giving us major hair envy. Exuding Old Hollywood glamour, the Virgin River actress has a standout style moment in the film when she steps out in a plunging red midi dress that's absolutely timeless.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6f9885a56b1b-annette-otoole-promo-photo-love-for-rent.jpg><p id=e0z_1Wl8Bwq data-wc=46>Following Love for Rent, Annette continued to thrive, bagging roles in Hollywood blockbusters 48 Hours (1982), Superman III (1983) and Cross My Heart (1987). And as for TV, the 71-year-old became a main cast member on series including It (1990), Nash Bridges (1996-98) and&nbsp;Smallville (2001-2011).&nbsp;</p><p id=efK6XkblBwL data-wc=43>During a 2021 interview with the Daily Planet, Annette reflected on her decade-spanning career. "I fell in love with acting like falling in love with a person and it has only gotten deeper!" she said. "All I wanted to do was just work."&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=ebhJrIWB6e8 data-wc=33>"I've worked with some not-so-wonderful people on projects that weren't as good as I'd hoped but I just continued to work and meet more people and just continued to get better," she added.&nbsp;</p><p id=exWLHcCIWPo data-wc=55>It was in 2018 that Annette signed on for season one of Virgin River and the rest, as we know, is history! Reflecting on what made her join the show, Annette told Smashing Interviews: "Sue Tenney, our original showrunner, called my agent and wanted to have a discussion with me about this project," she explained.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f704c605e012-hope-in-virgin-river.jpg><p id=efaX36GJUPR data-wc=37>"I think Tim [Matheson] was already onboard, and I'd worked with him three times in the past and have known him for a long time. So that was attractive, and she and I just talked about it."</p><p id=eMASHeKSv9 data-wc=16><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Virgin River season five early reactions are in and fans are saying the same thing</a></p><p id=e4-7C_v1Fc data-wc=18><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Virgin River's Alexandra Breckenridge shares tribute to cast and crew in candid message ahead of season five</a></p><p id=em-QszzTQCn data-wc=97>Annette continued: "I liked the idea of making that relationship between Hope and Doc prominent because if you're going to do a romantic story, older people also have romance in their lives or they have issues or relationship things they're dealing with … or not. But I wanted there to be as much about that couple as there was about the younger people in the show, and Sue probably brought that idea up first. So that was great, and she kind of depended on me to give her insight of what I was thinking about this person."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/90f0812734ae-hope-season-five-virgin-river.jpg><p id=eDHo0Z33TH1 data-wc=16>Fans can watch Annette in season five of Virgin River, which is now streaming on Netflix.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5uZ2pxaGd8t7XRoKCnZaKew6a%2BjJqlp52kqbJuu9OopqWdXZ%2BuuHnDq6apqJmjtG7Ax6umsJqRmLhuvsSdZKmkpaO0qrrGZpurnaOofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
