Moreover, he recently faced a pretty interesting fan interaction at a concert, where he almost got hit in the head by a Bible. Someone threw it at the Opium signee from the crowd, either for jokes or to stray him away from his "demonic music and messaging," as many have claimed. That Satanist conversation is oddly common in hip-hop, with some artists like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Doja Cat</a> leaning into wild conspiracies to clown its proponents. Regardless, with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a new album to celebrate</a>, we're sure that the 23-year-old had a lot of fun at one of his often chaotic shows.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, what this incident really points to is a disturbing trend in live performances: audiences throwing things at performers. Ken Carson is far from the first to experience this; recently, Death Grips cut an Arkasas show off during their time onstage because people kept throwing glow sticks at them. In addition, there's the infamous <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kid Cudi</a> incident at Rolling Loud Miami 2022, in which fans throwing water bottles at him resulted in him leaving barely four songs into the set. Sure, people pay to be there and do what they want, but that payment is also a contract of respect and decency with the artist and with the venue.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ken-carson-hit-by-bible-at-a-recent-show-watch>Ken Carson Hit By Bible At A Recent Show: Watch</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Even though this will likely continue to be an issue in the future, it can also be more harmless than its extremes suggest. Ken Carson already has rowdy shows, and if it's not the most disruptive or combative item, getting something thrown at you can be a sign of admiration. After all, many artists will take time to sign things that people throw at them or make jokes or remarks about it during the show. It's a relatively case-by-case basis, but the focus should be on what the negative reactions to it say about audience respectfulness and good concert etiquette.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, after some <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">solid commercial success</a> for A Great Chaos, it's clear that the Atlanta-born artist will continue his upward trajectory. Each and every show he plays will contain a lot of die-hard fans that absolutely love his sound. Let's just hope they don't injure him next time they throw a Bible- or just don't do so at all. On that note, stick around on HNHH for more news and updates on Ken Carson.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop.

Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C.
