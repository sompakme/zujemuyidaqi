As he does so, it appears that he still has some big backup in the locker room.</p><p>Mark Henry, in a recent interview on <a href=#>Busted Open Radio</a>, discussed various topics, including AEW President Tony Khan’s behavior on social media and his tendency to react strongly toward others.</p><p><a href=#>Tony Khan has often been ridiculed</a> for his social media activity. Mark Henry was there to defend TK in a big way, because, where Vince McMahon was, “take it or leave it,” with Tony Khan, things are very different.</p><p>“Vince never answered the critics. Vince told you what it was, gave you the product, and then said ‘Take it or leave it.’ Tony and Vince are different people. Tony is not only a good boss, but Tony is a fan of the people. He loves the fans because he was one. And him at his absolute, most critical point, Tony would’ve never did that. So he’s offended when a fan does that.”</p><p>“But I think that as AEW gets 10 years old, 15 years old, Tony will lose that. He’s entitled to his feelings about his child, 100%. And the people that incite a riot, I just would hope that somebody would say ‘Tony, that person is irrelevant. They’re just trying to burn the world, they’re trying to incite a riot. They just want to get some attention using you. Please, stay general.’”</p><p>Mark Henry is backing up Tony Khan in a big way, as a fan of the people. Vince McMahon is no longer running WWE, and the company is seeing a booming period in their history as well.</p><p>Tony Khan was a fan, who had a ton of money, so he opened his own company. Even as AEW enters into half a decade as a company, TK hasn’t forgotten where he came from. Only time will tell if Tony loses that in time. According to Mark Henry, he has a lot of positive attributes as well.</p><p>What’s your take on Tony Khan, and how he is running AEW?
