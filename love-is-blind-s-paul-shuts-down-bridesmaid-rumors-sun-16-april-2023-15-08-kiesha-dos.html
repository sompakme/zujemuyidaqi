Eagle-eyed fans saw an interaction between the two, and after saying no to getting married to Micah, they began jumping to conclusions.</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>season 4 Love is Blind cast</a> has kept us entertained for a number of weeks, and now we’ve finally seen who said I do and don’t at the altar. Of course, it wasn’t short of drama and surprises, but four seasons in, we know not to expect anything less.</p><p>We take a closer look at what Paul has said about the so-called <a href=#>Love is Blind</a> ‘scandal.’</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p><strong>Warning: Love is Blind season 4 spoilers ahead</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/04/Love_Is_Blind_S4_E3_00_01_31_13R-1024x576.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=paul-sparks-cheating-scandal-rumors-with-micahs-bridesmaid-on-love-is-blind>Paul sparks ‘cheating scandal’ rumors with Micah’s bridesmaid on Love is Blind</h2><p>In the final <a href=#>Netflix</a> episodes, we saw an emotional almost wedding between Paul and Micah, as he decided not to marry her at the aisle, leaving Micah running out in tears.</p><p>“I love you,” he said at the altar. “But, I don’t think that we can choose each other right now.”</p><p>However, some fans came to their own conclusions on why he said no, after spotting him ‘touching’ one of Micah’s bridesmaids on his way past.</p><p>Although some fans thought it was an accident, others on <a href=#>TikTok</a> disagree.</p><p>One fan wrote: “That was NO accident. Definitely was intentional. Micah’s bridesmaid was smiling too hard while Paul was saying no to Micah.”</p><p>“To me, he could’ve easily walked past without touching her. The hand was intentional on his part,” commented another.</p><p>However, others were quick to rush to Paul’s defense: “To me, it’s clear she was in the way of the exit, he bumped her by accident and took his hand out to be like ‘sorry.'”</p><p>“It’s not omg. He’s just doing a pardon me get out the way gesture,” another argued.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Gabbi here discovered something very interesting.

In a TikTok comment, Paul said: “Seriously reaching. Y’all want it to be true so bad.”</p><p>In another comment, he continued: “You’re insane if you think I’d slap a random girls a** (whom I don’t even know) during the most traumatic moment in my relationship.”</p><p>Of course, fans still had their questions as some FBI-like viewers had <a href=# rel=nofollow>obtained</a> screenshots of Paul liking bikini pics of the said bridesmaid, who has now turned her account to private.</p><p>In a discussion of why he called her ‘random’ when he followed her on Instagram, one fan said: “Love is Blind was filmed a year ago lol he may not of know her then and knows her now.”</p><p>Well, we guess we’ll have to wait until the live reunion to see what everyone has to say about this. One fan even took to TikTok to say they hope Vanessa and <a href=#>Nick Lachey</a> are on the app now to see all of this unfold, and honestly, we do too.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@storytimewithrikkii href=#>@storytimewithrikkii</a><p>Replying to @meepermeep101 Paul Responds to this whole bridemaids drama.
