The thing that's interesting about 1943 pennies is that most of them were made of steel. World War II was raging, and copper was needed for the war effort. The <a href=# title="1943 Steel Penny Value Guide and History">1943 steel penny</a> is still pretty valuable (sometimes worth $1,000 or more), but it's the pennies accidentally struck on bronze that are worth the most. The only one known to exist from the Denver Mint <a href=#>sold for $840,000 in 2021</a>.</p><h3>1943-S Bronze Cent</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cf.ltkcdn.net/antiques/images/std-xs/337082-340x167-1944-d.jpeg><p>The story of that minting mistake with the 1943 penny doesn't end at the Denver Mint. In fact, there were similar minting errors in San Francisco and Philadelphia when bronze planchets (coin blanks, in regular English) got stuck in the tote bins for the coin presses. Workers didn't notice the coins, and the most valuable wheat pennies entered circulation. There are only six known to have been minted in San Francisco, and <a href=#>one in excellent condition sold for $504,000 in 2020</a>.</p><h3>1943 (Philadelphia) Bronze Cent</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cf.ltkcdn.net/antiques/images/std-xs/337084-340x165-1914-s.jpeg><p>Basically, any time you see a 1943 penny, it's absolutely worth a second look. If it's bronze or copper colored, you're probably holding something that's worth a fortune. 1943 wheat pennies that don't have a mint letter were made in Philadelphia, where they also had the minting error with the bronze planchets. Collectors estimate around 20 of these coins exist today. One in excellent condition <a href=#>sold for $372,000 in 2021</a>.</p><h3>1944-D Steel Cent</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cf.ltkcdn.net/antiques/images/std-xs/337086-340x159-1921.jpeg><p>You know how there were mistakes made in the switch from copper to steel wheat pennies in 1943? Well, the country switched to pennies made from recycled shell case alloy in 1944, and the same mistake happened again. Fewer than 10 1944-D steel wheat pennies exist, and one in beautiful condition <a href=#>sold for $115,000 in 2007</a>.</p><h3>1909-S VDB Lincoln Cent</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cf.ltkcdn.net/antiques/images/std-xs/337088-340x163-1915-s.jpeg><p>The Lincoln penny was first minted in 1909, and the designer's initials (Victor David Brenner, or VDB) were included in the earliest design. When Treasury Department officials saw the minted pennies with the initials, they were displeased and tried to withdraw the coins from circulation. About 484,000 were struck at the San Francisco Mint, and very few of those stayed in circulation. Those that did tend to be worn, but one in near mint condition <a href=#>sold for $92,000 in 2005</a>.</p><h3>1914 Wheat Penny</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The 1914 Lincoln penny is something collectors actively search for, and they are <a href=#>up to 1000 times rarer</a> than a penny from today. In general, the 1914-D is actually rarer than the 1914-S, but condition is a major factor in value. The 1914-S is hard to find in nearly uncirculated condition, so if you do find one, it might be worth more than the rarer 1914-D. A 1914-S wheat penny in excellent condition <a href=#>sold for over $83,000 in 2008</a>.</p><h3>1922 No D Strong Reverse</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Sometimes, a coin is stamped harder on one side than the other, or the dies that create the design can be worn unevenly. While this isn't technically a minting error, it does make the coin unique and often more valuable. The 1922 No D doesn't have the D for the Denver Mint, despite being struck there. The wheat side of the penny, or the reverse, has a stronger stamp than the front side with Lincoln's portrait. In good condition, these can be very valuable. One <a href=#>sold in 2014 for over $67,000</a>.</p><h3>1921 Lincoln Cent</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Although the 1921 wheat penny isn't the rarest, it's very hard to come by in perfect condition. Only two are rated "superb," and they're worth a small fortune. One <a href=#>sold for over $55,000 in 2005</a>.</p><h3>1925-S Wheat Penny</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Many of the 1925 pennies from the San Francisco Mint were poorly produced, and those that were clear and crisp lost their crispness in circulation. It's very rare to find one in near mint condition, especially one that is clear and has good details. One in such shape <a href=#>sold for over $54,000 in 2005</a>.</p><h3>1915-S Wheat Penny</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Just like the 1925 version, the 1915 Lincoln cent from the San Francisco Mint generally lacked clarity and crispness. Finding one that wasn't circulated and is well defined is very rare, and they go for a premium. One <a href=#>sold for over $48,000 in 2005</a>.</p><p>Read More</p><h2>How to Spot a Wheat Penny Worth Money</h2><p>The most valuable wheat pennies might not be in your everyday pocket change, but there are a few things to look for if you're keeping an eye out for treasure:</p><ul><li>Early dates - Many of the wheaties worth the most money are those from the earliest years the coin was minted.</li><li>World War II years (1941-1945) - Pennies made during World War II can be valuable, especially if they are in a different metal than was the norm for that year.</li><li>Errors - If a penny has something weird about it, like double-stamped words or numbers, it's likely to be worth something.</li><li>Great condition - A penny with sharp, fine details and crisp edges is worth more than one that's lost detail due to circulation.</li></ul><p>Read More</p><h2>Look at the Details on Wheat Pennies</h2><p>Wheat pennies are always going to be rarer than more contemporary designs.
