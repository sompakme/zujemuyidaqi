Danielson wants another match against “Kenny No Balls,” but <a href=#>that contest is not booked. </a>It turns out that there is interest in holding that match elsewhere.</p><p>CM Punk dropped a him<a href=#> about competing in Mexico, </a>but it might have been in jest. The world is wide open with the Forbidden Door crack and AEW’s acceptance of cross-promotional match-ups.</p><p>According to the <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a>, Dorian Roldan, AAA’s booker, saw Danielson and Omega’s match. He really wants to see those two battle in his company. The fact that Kenny Omega is AAA Mega Champion could turn that contest into an actual title match.</p><p>C.M. Punk on Twitter said he’d like to do a match in Mexico City with Penta & Fenix vs. he and Bryan Danielson belts vs. beard. Dorian Roldan freaked out. Roldan had talked about wanting to do Danielson challenging Omega for the AAA Mega title after he saw their match last week.</p><p>It’s unknown if Tony Khan would allow this giant match-up to happen in AAA before they can run it again in AEW. One would have to think he might not like the idea and put a stop to it. You also never know what can happen in pro wrestling, because AAA doesn’t market their programming to American fans. That being said, a match that big would probably find its way to that fan base regardless of who AAA targets in their advertising.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
