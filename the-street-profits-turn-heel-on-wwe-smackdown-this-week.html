That being said, they still had a huge angel on the go-home episode of SmackDown before the biggest party of the summer.</p><p><a href=#>Click here for our complete coverage of WWE SmackDown this week.</a></p><p>The Brawling Brutes had an impromptu match scheduled with Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson this week on SmackDown. That match did not finish properly, because Montez Ford and Angelo Dawkins jumped in the ring, and while wearing suits, they beat The OC down.</p><p>After the beatdown, the Street Profits were joined on the entrance ramp by Bobby Lashley. He was looking very proud of himself, and the crowd loved seeing this segment go down. A huge cheer of appreciation for the angle erupted when The Almighty made his presence known.</p><p>They were featured in a segment last week where the Street Profits got new suits. <a href=#>That segment also featured notable cameo.</a></p><p>Before Vince McMahon’s temporary retirement, The Street Profits were regularly featured on WWE television and given a lot of focus. While speaking with&nbsp;<a href=#>Adam Silverstein on Getting Over</a>, Montez Ford and Angelo Dawkins talked about their growing frustrations in the tag team division and hinted at undergoing character changes.</p><p>I feel there is huge room for more of a demeanor change. The change that happened towards us, the feeling is real. Last year at SummerSlam was pretty much our last official time on the big stage to go for the tag team championships, and we didn’t succeed. That loss stung, still to this day. It’s been almost a year. The more you get these opportunities and the more time you don’t succeed, the more natural feeling of being upset and frustrated, which leads to a possible character change. Whatever you’re possibly doing, is not working. If the revolving situation keeps happening, the change must happen.</p><p>Those losses play a lot in my head, a bunch. It’s getting frustrating a little bit because you keep getting so close to something and it keeps slipping away. It’s right there at your fingertips and every time you try to do it the right way, it’s not gone your way. I’m sick and tired of waiting and going through all these hoops to get to where the goal is of being the champions. We’re going to start running through mugs in a minute.</p><p>You look at guys like Roman (Reigns) and (Austin) Theory, they aren’t doing it the right way, but they’ve been successful for a very long time. In the back of your mind, you go, ‘should I do the way that they’re doing or should I keep the righteousness and the ability and everything that has gotten us this far.’ You reach a plateau of doing what you’re doing for a long time and things don’t happen, so maybe a change has to happen. Eventually, frustrations do rise and change must happen.”</p><p>We will have to see what’s next for Montez Ford and Angelo Dawkins. This was certainly a big move for them prior to SummerSlam.</p><p>What’s your take on the Street Profits’ heel turn?
