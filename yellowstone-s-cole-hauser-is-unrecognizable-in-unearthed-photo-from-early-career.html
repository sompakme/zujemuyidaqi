Back in 2000, a then 25-year-old Cole joined the cast of Tigerland – and he's almost unrecognizable in these throwback snaps from the premiere.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/c3946dc808c6-gettyimages-104533618.jpg><p id=eyg1H5v7aw9 data-wc=55>Pictured walking the red carpet alongside <a class=hm-link href=#>his future wife, Cynthia Daniel</a>, the TV star looks so different with his natural red hair and clean-shaven face. Cole has previously spoken about his intense transformation for Yellowstone and in an interview with Jenny McCarthy, he opened up about the reason he dyes his hair for the series.</p><p id=eWjFNh99-vq data-wc=8><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Yellowstone star Cole Hauser's famous wife revealed</a></p><p id=eO_24X_Xnl data-wc=9><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Yellowstone star reacts to Matthew McConaughey spin-off show</a></p><p id=etaZtFB5Wr data-wc=94>Revealing that the show's creator, Taylor Sheridan, had suggested he dye it to avoid looking too similar to his on-screen love interest Kelly Reilly, Cole explained: "When I first got the role, as you know Kelly's a ginger and I'm ginger as well. So we looked like we were brother and sister! So we kind of had to make sure that wouldn't be the case." He added: "I've dyed it for other stuff that I've done. They liked that look, and it's kind of a harder look. Your eyes pop a little bit more."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/14beac5d9334-gettyimages-104533616.jpg><p id=euBGDZ5Svp7 data-wc=57>In June 2022, Cole also revealed that he has to dramatically alter his weight for the role of Rip Wheeler. "Ultimately, when I walk around, I'm about 210 [pounds]," he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Express</a>. "I put on, sometimes, about 20 pounds just to fill him out. And get a little bit more [expletive] and legs on him, you know!"</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Everything you need to know about the cast of Yellowstone</figure><p id=eKAARibQlTc data-wc=75>While the role can be demanding, it's all worth it for Cole. In an interview with Jimmy Fallon, the 48-year-old revealed what drew him to the character of Rip. "He has a darkness that I love and a passion with Beth," Cole began. "I just thought, you know, this is a character that not only can grow, but there are tons of colors. And so, as an actor, that's kind of what you dream of."</p><p id=ewa8puleCY data-wc=26><strong>Don't want to miss a story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our What to Watch newsletter</a> and get the heads-up on the shows and films everyone’s talking about.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tb3JqYGp8urHLpaawq6Sku6Z5wqijnmWYlsK0sdFmrKebopqwsLPNorGampyaerW00aium5mToHqxtM6tpmadkae5unnCmqmenaJk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
