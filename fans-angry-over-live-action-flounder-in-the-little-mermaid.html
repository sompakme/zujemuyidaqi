Many joked about the fish appearing to look "too realistic" while others compared his looks to Steve Buscemi. The concerns come just weeks ahead of its highly anticipated premiere.</p><p>"Maybe I’m being out of line here, but I was expecting The Little Mermaid characters to be idk… CUTE," one person complained, as noted by The Daily Mail. "Live action animation doesn’t have to be expressionless. At least give our boy Flounder his chubby cheeks back!!!!!" Another asked, "Why does Flounder look like a depressed 40-year-old chain smoker with three kids and a mortgage he can't pay." One more user posted, "NOT MY FLOUNDER GETTING THE STEVE BUSCEMI TREATMENT. Y'ALL I'M CRYIN." Another user also made the same comparison: "Not they put Flounder on Ozempic! Why he so skinny??? This fish look like Steve Buscemi."</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-halle-bailey-on-stage-at-d23-expo-2022>Halle Bailey On Stage At D23 Expo 2022</h2></span><p>ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA - SEPTEMBER 09: (L-R) Rob Marshall and Halle Bailey speak onstage during D23 Expo 2022 at Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California on September 09, 2022.

However, the criticism of his looks picked up stream after Disney released the film's character posters later in the day. The social media account for the Southlake, Texas Department of Public Safety even called the visual “a crime,” and joked, “we’re just trying to find out which one.”</p><p>The upcoming live-action take on The Little Mermaid is directed by Rob Marshall. It stars <a href=# rel>Halle Bailey</a> in the titular role with the supporting cast made up of Jonah Hauer-King, Daveed Diggs, Awkwafina, Jacob Tremblay, Noma Dumezweni, Javier Bardem, and Melissa McCarthy. The Little Mermaid will hit theaters on May 26. It will be the latest of several adaptations Disney has done in the live-action style. They also remade Mulan in 2020, The Lion King in 2019, and more, with additional films scheduled for release in the coming years.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-flounder-in-the-little-mermaid>Flounder In "The Little Mermaid"</h2></span><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdma4V5gZFmnZqmo2Kur7PRsmSfpJ%2Bqu6Wx0Wajoq6VYq6kwMiopWasmJp6rbXTraOeZZ2av66tyJ0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
