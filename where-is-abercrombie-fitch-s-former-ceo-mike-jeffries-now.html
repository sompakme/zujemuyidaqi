Here's the true story behind Netflix's latest doc.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60"><strong>Abercrombie and Fitch's history might surprise you</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Mike Jeffries took on the role of CEO of Abercrombie and Fitch in 1992, via <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-01-22/the-aging-of-abercrombie-fitch-i58ltcqx data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Bloomberg class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>Bloomberg</u></a>. At the time, the brand had already been around for a century, starting life as a sporting goods store in 1892. In its previous iteration, Abercrombie was less about topless models with steel abs, and more about making hunting and fishing wear with a classic American twist. In fact, before it became a teen hotspot, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://corporate.abercrombie.com/our-company/about-us/company-history data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Abercrombie and Fitch had dressed" data-vars-ga-product-id=f650b035-33c5-4ec8-a2fb-d5069bfa40a1 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://corporate.abercrombie.com/our-company/about-us/company-history data-product-url=https://corporate.abercrombie.com/our-company/about-us/company-history data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcorporate.abercrombie.com%2Four-company%2Fabout-us%2Fcompany-history" data-affiliate-network='{"afflink_redirect":"/afflink/THtU/abercrombie","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","network":{"name":"Skimlinks"}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand=corporate.abercrombie.com data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=d6f65088-39ee-409a-a155-e8882b1572a2 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=corporate.abercrombie.com class="body-link product-links css-1xesb7e e1aq0z090"><u>Abercrombie and Fitch had dressed</u></a> icons like John F. Kennedy, Amelia Earhart, and President Theodore Roosevelt.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite its storied past, the company struggled to maintain its fanbase, and filed for bankruptcy in 1976, via <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/abercrombie-and-fitch-hollister-history-relevancy-crisis/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Business of Business" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>The Business of Business</u></a>. After one unsuccessful relaunch, Abercrombie was acquired in 1988 by The Limited's Les Wexner for $47 million. Wexner, of course, is famous for buying <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a36766170/victorias-secret-getting-rid-of-angels-launching-the-vs-collective/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Victoria's Secret" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>Victoria's Secret</u></a> in 1982 for just $1 million and turning it into an extremely profitable entity, via <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.forbes.com/profile/les-wexner/?sh=224a155ae668" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Forbes class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>Forbes</u></a>. His Abercrombie purchase turned into a similar success story.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">By the early '00s, Abercrombie's sister brand Hollister was picking up speed, and both labels were quickly taken international. As <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/how-abercrombie-ended-up-being-sued-by-250000-employees/#:~:text=62%2C000%20Employees&text=Former%20employees%20Alexander%20Brown%20and,to%20wear%20on%20the%20job." data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Fashion Law" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>The Fashion Law</u></a> reported, at its peak, "Abercrombie boasted a network of 700 dimly-lit and thoroughly fragranced stores, 22,000 strikingly attractive employees and nearly $2 billion in annual sales." Basically, there's a good chance that at some point you ventured into the brand's low-lit paradise or ogled its oiled-up, shirtless greeters from a safe distance.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60"><strong>Why is there controversy surrounding ex-CEO Mike Jeffries?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When Jeffries was handed the role, he was 48-years-old, and moved over from women's brand Paul Harris, via The Fashion Law. Little is known about Jeffries' private life. The CEO was previously <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/14/archives/susan-hansen-sets-nuptials.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="married to Susan Hansen" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>married to Susan Hansen</u></a>, with whom he shares a son.</p><img alt="netflix white hot mike jeffries" title="netflix white hot mike jeffries" width=1828 height=948 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/white-hot-mike-jeffries-1650035084.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Netflix</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Throughout his time at the fashion giant, Jeffries reportedly attempted to cultivate a youthful image of his own. As Bloomberg reported in 2014, "Jeffries, who is 70, tried to keep up appearances. He lifted weights, barefoot, in the company gym most mornings. He dyed his hair blond and regularly visited his plastic surgeon." And his uniform of choice? "[T]orn Abercrombie jeans and flip-flops," of course.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As well as cultivating a particular look, Jeffries quickly became known for his often exclusionary commentary about the Abercrombie and Fitch customer. A <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.salon.com/2006/01/24/jeffries/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2006 Salon interview" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>2006 Salon interview</u></a> was especially damning following the company's recent settlement as Jeffries said, "That's why we hire good-looking people in our stores. Because good-looking people attract other good-looking people, and we want to market to cool, good-looking people. We don't market to anyone other than that."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As if his statement about "good-looking people" wasn't clear enough, Jeffries also told Salon, "In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids. Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don’t belong [in our clothes], and they can’t belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely. I think that what we represent sexually is healthy. It's playful. It's not dark. It's not degrading!" added the then-CEO. "And it's not gay, and it's not straight, and it's not black, and it's not white. It's not about any labels." (He <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/abercrombie-and-fitch-ceo-mike-jeffries-apologizes-for-cool-kids-comment-2013175/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="apologized for the statement following the interview in 2013" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>apologized for the statement following the interview in 2013</u></a>).</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60"><strong>What allegations have been made against Abercrombie and Fitch?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Netflix's White Hot specifically details Abercrombie and Fitch's era with Jeffries at the helm. During this time, and after it, the company has faced several lawsuits and drawn criticism from multiple communities who have accused the brand of employment discrimination. Abercrombie and Fitch have regularly denied these allegations.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For instance, a 2003 class action lawsuit <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903100854/http://www.afjustice.com/pdf/20050422_consent_decree.pdf data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="was filed against the brand" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">was filed against the brand</a>, alleging that Abercrombie and Fitch had perpetrated "discrimination against African-American, Latino and Asian American applicants and employees." A settlement was reached in November 2004 totaling $40 million dollars, according to the<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/17/us/abercrombie-fitch-bias-case-is-settled.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" New York Times," class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"> New York Times,</a> with the company required to increase diversity within its hiring practices and implement diversity and inclusion training as a result, something that's discussed at length in White Hot.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After Abercrombie settled the lawsuit, Jeffries told Salon, "I don't think we were in any sense guilty of racism, but I think we just didn't work hard enough as a company to create more balance and diversity. And we have, and I think that's made us a better company. We have minority recruiters. And if you go into our stores you see great-looking kids of all races."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Abercrombie and Fitch was hit with another major lawsuit in 2008. Per the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/abercrombie-resolves-religious-discrimination-case-following-supreme-court-ruling-favor data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a>, "The case involved Abercrombie's refusal to hire Samantha Elauf, a Muslim, because of her religious practice of wearing a hijab. ... She was denied hire for failing to conform to the company's 'look policy,' which Abercrombie claimed banned head coverings."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">However, via the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, "the Supreme Court held that an employer may not refuse to hire an applicant if the employer was motivated by avoiding the need to accommodate a religious practice. Such behavior violates the prohibition on religious discrimination contained in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964." In 2015, Elauf received monetary damages from Abercrombie following the Supreme Court ruling.</p><img alt="white hot netflix" title="white hot netflix" width=1722 height=908 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/white-hot-netflix-1650035162.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Netflix</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Abercrombie and Fitch also regularly faced criticisms, many of which are explored in White Hot. For instance, the company (under new leadership) was forced to withdraw many shirts from circulation after <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/ABERCROMBIE-GLITCH-Asian-Americans-rip-2850702.php#photo-2227086 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="accusations of racism in 2022" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>accusations of racism in 2022</u></a>, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.salon.com/2003/11/26/abercrombie/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Salon was less-than-impressed" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>Salon was less-than-impressed</u></a> with the brand's apology.

In 2011, a woman protested the company's children's brand, abercrombie, for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/04/woman-protesting-push-up-bras-for-young-girls-at-abercrombie-fitch-cited-by-mall-security.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="selling padded bikinis to children" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>selling padded bikinis to children</u></a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The brand also faced extensive backlash for refusing to cater for plus-sizes at some of their retail locations, with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2013/05/abercrombie-fitch-faces-protests-backlash-for-not-selling-larger-sizes data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="ABC News" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">ABC News</a> reporting in 2013, "There was no clothing for women in sizes larger than a 10, and salespeople at the store confirmed that Abercrombie doesn't carry XL or XXL sizes for women [at specifically the New York City store]." And, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/09/controversial-abercrombie-fitch-ceo-michael-jeffries-to-retire data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Guardian" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">The Guardian</a>, Abercrombie and Fitch’s strategy at one point included "refusing to create large-size clothes, limiting the biggest shirt sizes to 'large' and pants to size 10."</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60"><strong>Where is Mike Jeffries now? And what about Abercrombie?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2014, Jeffries stepped down from his role as Abercrombie and Fitch's CEO, according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/09/controversial-abercrombie-fitch-ceo-michael-jeffries-to-retire data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Guardian" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>The Guardian</u></a>.

Discussing the documentary in an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cbx91NxhxVu/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Instagram post" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>Instagram post</u></a>, the official Abercrombie account stated, "While the problematic elements of that era have already been subject to wide and valid criticism over the years, we want to be clear that they are actions, behaviors and decisions that would not be permitted or tolerated at the company now."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.netflix.com/title/81323741 data-vars-ga-call-to-action="WATCH WHITE HOT ON NETFLIX" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-9271a0 emevuu60">WATCH WHITE HOT ON NETFLIX</a></p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/32a17ebf-adab-48ef-a723-758c53a8bea8_1524066273.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Amy Mackelden" title="Headshot of Amy Mackelden" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Amy Mackelden is a freelance writer, editor, and disability activist.
