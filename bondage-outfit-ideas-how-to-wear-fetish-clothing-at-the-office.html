After&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/news/a14357/taylor-swift-bad-blood/>the video for "Bad Blood"</a>&nbsp;was released and I read about&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-redirect=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/news/a14487/taylor-swift-bondage-store/ data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/>from whence the wardrobe department sourced those slinky tops</a>, I was like, "Pssssshh. You know what would be harder than wearing bondage to fire missile launchers at your enemies? Wearing bondage to&nbsp;work." Then I immediately regretted it, because my boss was like&nbsp;"YES YOU SHOULD TRY IT."</p><p>Then I regretted it more when I checked the forecast and saw temperatures in the 90s.&nbsp;</p><p>So that I would not suffer alone/more of the MarieClaire.com&nbsp;team could suffer together, my editor roped Lauren Valenti into joining me on the photo-shoot part of this journey of near-constant discomfort.&nbsp;[Editor's note: MWAHAHAHHAHAHAA.]&nbsp;We went on&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://www.syren.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Syren.com</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;authenticity&nbsp;and picked out enough rubber to wallpaper Christian Grey's playroom twice over.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6keLsSpTo2fNZUg2bhPfXL-1920-80.jpg><p>Lauren looks very naughty librarian, no? Blouse, Syren; glasses,&nbsp;William Morris Black Label; hair and makeup: Glamsquad.&nbsp;</p><p>When you make the grave mistake of doing a fetish-clothing story in July, you receive a free education in the laws of fluid dynamics. The sweat doesn't absorb then dry like it does when you wear other fabrics—it collects, traveling in sheets like those that circulate along the walls of Slurpee machines or&nbsp;the ones they have at&nbsp;Shake Shack that stir lemonade so the pulp doesn't settle. I learned this after walking 30 blocks in a racer-front latex&nbsp;crop top&nbsp;and almost keeling over from heatstroke/dehydration because 80 percent of the liquid in my body had pooled on my back.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/THpfH37MQu7TBXUbMiFg7Z-1920-80.jpg><p>This is me trying not to melt.

(The baby powder is&nbsp;supposed to reduce the friction so that it only takes 15 minutes to put on a catsuit instead of 30. This is not an exaggeration.)&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AdDCtXBQXBD4Tfd6mQK7G9-1920-80.jpg><p>Doing some very important mapping.

IRL, too, nobody really reacted, probably because 1) this is New York, and 2) I was so sweaty they were scared striking up a conversation might send me into cardiac arrest.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ojjzLdZ7nsQCFA5yw34kP-1920-80.jpg><p>There's something awesomely scary&nbsp;about this.

Latex, by nature, is insular—it literally sucks everything in—and&nbsp;pulling it off also depends on the interior. I'm not suggesting you repeat this challenge in your own workplace, but from my own experience, all you would need to make it, or any other risky outfit, a success&nbsp;is some&nbsp;confidence. But&nbsp;who knows? If you *were* to try it, you might like how it made&nbsp;you&nbsp;lose&nbsp;some&nbsp;most of your water weight in the process.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJ6RqLWqu81opZ6vo2SucoGQcmtomp%2BjsaKzxGauqKqbrLKivo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
