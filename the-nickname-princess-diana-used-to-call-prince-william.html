Given that he was just a baby, William did not bring back any memories from the trip. However, he did bring back a nickname that has withstood the test of time, he told Matt Lauer in a 2007 interview with <a href=#>NBC News</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>During the trip, Diana took William to see a wombat, a local animal, and she began to affectionally call her baby son that.

Or maybe I do," William said.</p><p>William spent much of the six-week tour separated from his parents as they tended to their jam-packed agenda, as <a href=#>Elle</a> noted.
