Sadly, he announced on Thursday morning (June 20) that he has to cancel his slots at <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Lollapalooza in Chicago on August 1</a> and Outside Lands in San Francisco on August 10. These festivals acted quickly to secure replacements, though, and fans will be treated to <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Megan Thee Stallion</a> and Sabrina Carpenter instead, respectively. While this news surely disappointed many fans and concert-goers, unfortunately not all live performances can work out as scheduled, and the Los Angeles native just so happened to be the latest example in this common reality.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I hate saying this but I have to cancel Lollapalooza and Outside Lands," <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Tyler, The Creator</a> wrote on Twitter, which contained a vague explanation and sincere apologies and remorse. "I made a commitment that I can no longer keep, and that bums me out knowing <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">how excited folks were</a>. That is not sexy at all. Please please forgive me or call me names when you see me in person. Love."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-tyler-the-creator-pulls-out-of-lollapalooza-amp-outside-lands-festivals>Tyler The Creator Pulls Out Of Lollapalooza & Outside Lands Festivals</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Of course, this carries a particularly different sting to it depending on whether or not you went to <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kendrick Lamar</a>'s "Pop Out" concert last night (Wednesday, Juneteenth). Tyler, The Creator was <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">one of many hometown artists who came out for a special guest performance</a>, electrifying the crowd with "WUSYANAME" and "EARFQUAKE." Out of all the surprises and invitees both onstage and in the crowd, the Hawthorne creative was probably the one that shocked fans the most. After all, his name didn't appear much in fan speculation about who would join K.Dot for the momentous occasion, and not a single soul complained about this welcome link-up.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, for anyone that knows the extent of Tyler, The Creator's longevity as an artist and performer, they know that he will likely repay these canceled festival headline sets soon with more great performances. Also, this longevity became very apparent in his music when <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">his 2013 album Wolf recently reached over a billion streams on Spotify</a>. Hopefully Golf Wang fans who looked forward to Lollapalooza and Outside Lands get another chance soon to see their GOAT. But at least Los Angeles got a special treat to make up for it.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop.

Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre.

Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C.
