Sure, it wasn't <a href=# rel>the Davis-Garcia matchup</a>, but this weekend had matches of all shapes and sizes for combat sports fans. Moreover, Blue beat the TikTok star via technical knock out in the fourth round, which took place Saturday night (April 22) at the OVO Arena Wembley in London, England and was presented by Kingpyn Boxing. As Blueface pummeled Matthews with head shots in the ropes, the referee intervened and called the fight in the rapper's favor.</p><p>Later, Blueface took to Twitter to celebrate his win and also ask why the ref had to step in. "Was anybody else confused about the ref saving ED why they wouldn’t let me finish him," he asked on the social media platform. After winning the fight, he had a strong message for fans and his potential next opponents. From what he expressed to the arena, <a href=# rel>he wants to fight someone with the bag</a>, as he could fight anytime for free if he wanted to.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-blueface-technically-knocks-out-ed-matthews>Blueface (Technically) Knocks Out Ed Matthews</h2></span><p>"<a href=# rel>Like I said before</a>, I’m going to take him [Ed Matthews] to deep waters where he can’t swim and I’m going to be victorious," Blueface remarked. "Thank you to everyone for coming out. I did this for myself, I love to fight. I’ve been fighting for free for a long time so if they’ve got money then I’m fighting. Ain’t nobody worth me calling out, so tell them to call me with some money in the contract and we'll fight." The 26-year-old's message certainly rings true, as he often brags about his various sources of income and is always looking for more.</p><p>Meanwhile, the California rapper recently sparked some more beef, but it won't result in a fight. Moreover, <a href=# rel>he reignited a feud with his mother</a>, dissing her quite harshly during an interview with RapTV. In fact, she even responded to his digs, and distanced herself from her son in kind. Hopefully they can sort things out and the artist can keep his feuds strictly to the boxing ring for people with a bag that didn't raise him.
