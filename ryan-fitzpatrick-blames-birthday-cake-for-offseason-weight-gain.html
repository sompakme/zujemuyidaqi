The veteran 36-year-old became a bit of a meme last season with his "Fitzmagic" nickname that came in light of some otherworldly performances at the start of the season. Coming into 2019, Fitzpatrick will be playing with the Miami Dolphins and from the first photos that were released of him, it's clear he was looking very out of shape.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Fitzpatrick is currently at the team's voluntary workouts and was swarmed by the media yesterday where he ended up addressing his weight. The QB said his weight gain can be chalked up to an abundance of birthday cake which is something I think we can all relate to.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"The thing with me is I have seven kids," Fitzpatrick said,&nbsp;<a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">via the Miami Herald.</a>&nbsp;"So, in January, we have three birthdays. We've got a family birthday party, which includes cake. And then, we've got a friends birthday party, which includes cake. So that's six times in January. We've got three birthdays in March - March 1, March 6 and March 11 - which again is a tough stretch. That's cake six out of 10 or 11 days. Then, we've got an April birthday, so it doesn't slow down."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Now that the NFL season is a few months away, Fitzpatrick says he's committed to getting back in shape.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Now that I've got all the birthdays behind me, I'm going to try to go from peak offseason form maybe down (to) peak in-season form," he said. "I'll be OK."</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop. He started at HotNewHipHop back in 2018 where he began as a Sports and Sneakers writer.
