Wallen was spotted at the five-star Chiltern Firehouse restaurant and hotel in London's Mayfair district alongside Josie Canseco, daughter of A's great Jose Canseco. The pair reportedly had a "great time" for around two hours before Wallen left, per TMZ. It's unclear how the pair became acquainted.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Wallen's dating life has been something of a mystery since he split from ex-fiancee Katie Smith. He had brief flings with Paige Lorenze and Megan Moroney. However, TMZ was unable to ascertain if his dinner with Canseco was anything serious or just two friends grabbing a meal. Wallen has a son, Indigo, with Smith. Meanwhile, Canseco's exes include Brody Jenner and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Logan Paul</a>. It remains to be seen if and when they will link up again in the near future.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-morgan-wallen-links-up-with-jimmy-butler>Morgan Wallen Links Up With Jimmy Butler</h2></span><p>NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE - NOVEMBER 08: EDITORIAL USE ONLY Morgan Wallen performs onstage during the 57th Annual CMA Awards at Bridgestone Arena on November 08, 2023 in Nashville, Tennessee.

Jimmy Butler shared a brief moment with Wallen after a concert Wallen did in Toronto in September. Obviously, that's a long way for Butler to come given his base in Miami. However, the two men were clearly very happy to see each other. They reportedly chatted for a few minutes before going their separate ways after the show.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As mentioned, Wallen has been absolutely crushing it this year. His album, One Day At A Time, spent 15 weeks at #1 on the Billboard 200. That included an 11-week run between March and June. He has also spent #16 weeks at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 with "Last Night". That includes a dominant 10-week run between May and July. The song most recently topped the chart for two weeks in August.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Benjamin Mock (they/them) is a sports and culture writer working out of Philadelphia.
