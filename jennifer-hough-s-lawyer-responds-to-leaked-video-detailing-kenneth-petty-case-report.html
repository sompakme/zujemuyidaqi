Fans got #JusticeForThePettys to trend following the video but it appears that there are sources questioning the validity of the leaked video. Jason Lee, who has butted heads with Nicki and the Barbz on several occasions, wound up getting roped into the whole debacle, beginning with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Cardi B</a>'s explosive back-and-forth on Twitter. Lee revealed that he's been in contact with Jennifer Hough's lawyer to land an exclusive interview discussing the recently revealed footage. Her lawyer,<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">&nbsp;Tyrone A.

Nicki's team should post the entire conversation and not just snippets. We are not worried! In fact the Queens DA is in the process of compiling over 200 pages of documents stemming from the 1994/5 rap hearing and conviction which we will use in our civil case against Kenneth," Blackburn wrote.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In another statement issued to Radar Online, he echoed a similar sentiment.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"This heavily edited video conversation with Jennifer and Black (the same man that threatened her life on IG live) does not deserve a comment. Ask that rapist to explain the transcript from his plea hearing where he admitted to attempting to rape Jennifer with a knife at his grandmother's house," Blackburn said.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">We will keep you posted on any more updates surrounding the case.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
