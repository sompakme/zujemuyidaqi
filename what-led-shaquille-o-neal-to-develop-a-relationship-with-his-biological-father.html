As <a href=#>Andscape</a> explains, this had an impact on both <a href=#>Shaq's life</a> and mental health. Shaq once made a rap song called "Biological Didn't Bother" (posted on <a href=#>YouTube</a>) in reference to his absent father. "I want to dedicate this song to Philip Arthur Harrison / Word up / Cause he was the one who took me from a boy to a man / So as far as I'm concerned, he is my father cause my biological didn't bother" are some of the lyrics in the song (via <a href=#>Genius</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=#>Sports Keeda</a>, Shaq's father Toney turned to a life of crime, eventually going to prison for six years for drug possession and check forgery. Toney turned his life around afterwards, getting a legitimate job as a delivery truck driver helping out shelters. Toney didn't immediately try to seek out his son to make amends, however, only doing so three years after Shaq's stepfather, Philip Harrison, died. Shaq himself opened up to the idea of meeting with Toney after his mother suggested it.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9j3BscWtgZMSprdNmo56cXai1or3UoqOlnV2ku6aty2arqGWUmsOmuM6pZJplopq5osDIqKWsoJmleri106FkoaGjYq%2Bqu8uonqKbkaF6p63ToZyrZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
