I feel it.' I mean, you're at a wedding dress shop, you have beautiful gowns, there's charcuterie boards, and your family's there, and there's champagne," she continued.

We didn't go visit the families, but we went to their apartments, and we sat down with them in their apartments, and some of them made us dinner, and some of them just had some wine, and we went with them. We did a lot. And so we really felt the entire process through and through."</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
