They actually kept things very low key and wed in a courthouse in California, according to <a href=#>People</a>, with the nuptials being kept top secret with only a few witnesses in attendance.</p><p>But, sadly, this one wasn't built to last. Just a year later in March 2019, <a href=#>TMZ Sports</a> confirmed that it was splitsville for the two as the former Cleveland Browns player described the breakup as "all very, very personal and very sad." He added, "I appreciate everyone who has been so supportive of both of us and I would just ask that everyone respect our privacy at this difficult time."</p><p>As for what caused the split? Well, Tiesi appeared to suggest her estranged husband hadn't been faithful. Responding to a social media user who inquired about their split in the comments section on Instagram, the model hit back (via <a href=#>TMZ Sports</a>), "I don't do betrayal for a person I was devoted to period. Vows were broken f*** money and f*** u and every other loser on here." The pretty telling message was posted mere days before the divorce papers were filed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcG9lan90e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2fvKm6zbJkppmer7amuIyapZ1lkqeybsDInqqiq12Ztre70ZycaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
