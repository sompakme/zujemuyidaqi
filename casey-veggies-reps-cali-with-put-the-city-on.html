While he has been releasing music since the late 2000s and early 2010s, he never really had the star power. He floats in between mainstream and underground and that might be the reason why. Additionally, it will almost be two years since his last album, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Crypto Veggies</a>, dropped. Furthermore, since the tape that featured Natalia Shanelle, Yun-A, nNo, and more, Casey has remained fairly quiet.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In 2023, the 30-year-old only pushed out a handful of singles. In fact, one out of the two was not even his single. The closest he came to dropping a full project was the EP, Ten Toes Down. Casey worked alongside Futuristiks: Mike & Keys for the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">five-song tape</a>. That came out in the early half of May. Maybe 2024 will be a more active one for the Cali veteran.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-put-the-city-on-by-casey-veggies>Listen To "Put The City On" By Casey Veggies</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">To kick off the new year, Casey Veggies has come through with a quick two-minute single.
