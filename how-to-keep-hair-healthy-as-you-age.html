In fact, in second grade, one of my classmates remarked that my hair was "stringy" — rude, yes, but undeniably accurate.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, years later, my thirties and forties have been marked by a couple of periods of acute hair loss. The first was in my early thirties when I experienced <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>telogen effluvium</a>, a condition that causes excessive hair shedding due to stress or a traumatic event. (I had recently broken up with a long-term boyfriend, and I didn't have a full-time job since getting laid off a few months earlier.) The hair eventually grew back, but <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>losing hair because of stress</a> is, in and of itself, a stressful event — trust me.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The second time was when my son was around three months old and I was 42. Every time I washed my hair, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>clumps would fall out</a>. This went on for more than a year. How was it possible that I was losing so much hair and somehow still had hair to lose? It's now slowly growing back, but in the meantime, I have some wisps around my hairline that are noticeably shorter than the rest of my hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both of these incidents have made me wonder whether there are any steps I can take to try to ensure that the hair I do have stays as healthy as possible — and to prevent as much hair loss as I can. Here are five things every woman in her 40s should be doing to keep her hair healthy — and some advice on what to do if you've already started losing your hair.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-1-stay-hydrated></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>1. Stay Hydrated</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We hear lots of advice about hydration when it comes to skin, but it's also extremely important for our hair health. "Drinking a lot of water helps with everything," says celebrity hairstylist, author, and educator <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Monae Everett</a>. "Hair needs to be moisturized for hair growth and growth retention."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A good rule of thumb is for your daily water intake to be between half an ounce to an ounce for each pound you weigh (so someone weighing 140 pounds would drink between 70 and 140 ounces per day).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2-avoid-over-washing-your-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2. Avoid Over-Washing Your Hair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Be sure not to over-wash your hair — that can really dry it out," says Ashley Streicher, hair stylist to Mandy Moore and Anne Hathaway and co-owner of the Beverly Hills beauty salon <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>STRIIIKE</a>. "It's definitely a thing that I see a lot."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But figuring out what constitutes over-washing for yourself might take a bit of trial and error, says hair restoration and facial plastic surgeon <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Gary Linkov</a>. "You want to wash it enough that you get rid of the oily grime that blocks pores, so not showering for a week at a time is not ideal — but taking too frequent showers can dry out the hair, dry out the scalp and skin and can also be a problem." He suggests starting by washing hair every other day and seeing how your hair adapts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For Black women, Everett suggests shampooing weekly, "even if you're wearing a protective style. You can shampoo braids, you can shampoo weaves — scalp health is crazy important."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: InStyle On: Salon Naturals</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-3-be-mindful-of-how-you-style-your-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>3. Be Mindful of How You Style Your Hair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Be gentle with your hair," says Everett. "All of these styles that are pulling and tugging on your hair — your hair is not as forgiving as it once was!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Linkov also advises avoiding high-heat blow dryers and "harsh chemicals with different treatments for hair at the salon."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-4-consider-a-hair-supplement></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>4. Consider a Hair Supplement</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"As we age we stop producing as much oil and collagen, which not only affects our skin, but our hair," says Streicher. "I love a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>collagen supplement</a>, or a hair and skin supplement."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Linkov recommends biotin-based supplements like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Nutrafol</a> and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Viviscal</a>, whose effectiveness have been shown through research and studies, but also points out that many foods are rich in biotin (aka Vitamin B7), including egg yolks, legumes, nuts and seeds, liver, sweet potatoes, bananas, and mushrooms.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-5-if-you-notice-hair-loss-consult-a-doctor></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>5. If You Notice Hair Loss, Consult a Doctor</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Linkov says that for women, the causes of hair loss can be multifaceted and can include changing estrogen levels, low Vitamin D levels, thyroid conditions, and autoimmune conditions, as well as temporary conditions like telogen effluvium.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Treatments can include Minoxidil (aka <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Rogaine</a>), <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Propecia</a> (although not for women of childbearing age), and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>spironolactone</a>, which is commonly prescribed for acne but "it's been shown to have very nice effects on hair restoration," says Linkov. "Women specifically do quite well on that from a hair perspective."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The New Age</strong> is a column about beauty over 40, written by women who are over 40.
