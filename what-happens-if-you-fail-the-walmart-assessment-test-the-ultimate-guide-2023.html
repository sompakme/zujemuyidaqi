It doesn’t discriminate between job titles and pay levels. No matter which position you are applying for, you’ll need to complete and pass it.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Test is split up into four sections which focus on your own personal skills across customer service, problem-solving, previous work experience, and your work personality.</span></p><h3><span id=Let8217s_take_a_look_at_them8230><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Let’s take a look at them…</span></span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The first part is focused on customer service and is scenario-based; you will be asked to answer a series of questions based on what you would do in the given situation. The second is problem-solving, where you determine how you would react in certain situations, or what you would do if something, either negative or positive, happens.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The next is focused on your previous work experience and asks a range of questions that you will need to answer to assess your skill set. While the fourth section focuses on your personality and works like a survey. Asking a number of questions you need to answer on a scale ranging from strongly agree through to strongly disagree.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span id=How_hard_is_it_to_pass><span data-preserver-spaces=true>How hard is it to pass?</span></span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It’s important to note that even if you fail just one part of this four part assessment, the whole test is deemed as a fail. Walmart is incredibly strict on this, as all four components are as important as each other. Therefore you can’t ace one section and expect it will help hold up a poorly answered section.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>They are all marked individually, and as stated, if one section is a fail, the whole test is a fail, and you will not be able to go any further with that application.</span></p><h2><span id=What_Happens_if_I_Fail_This_Test><span data-preserver-spaces=true>What Happens if I Fail This Test?</span></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>If you have just completed the application and test and your results come back as a fail. You may be wondering what your next steps are.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Can you go apply again immediately? Or is that the end for potentially working with America’s biggest employer?</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Thankfully you’ll be able to take the test again, but not for another six months. During this time, you won’t be able to work in any position within the company. But the good news here is that you will be able to reapply.</span></p><h2><span id=What_Happens_If_You_Fail_The_Walmart_Assessment_Test_8211_Is_The_Walmart_Test_Hard><span data-preserver-spaces=true>What Happens If You Fail The Walmart Assessment Test? – Is The Walmart Test Hard?</span></span></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/the-walmart-interview-questions.png alt="What Happens If You Fail The Walmart Assessment Test? - Is The Walmart Test Hard?" width=800 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>ze</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Many applicants wonder if the test is hard. The answer is no!</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The test is simply put in place to evaluate how well you will work under a supervisor, or within a team, or how you would cope when put in a difficult or unfamiliar situation.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>There are no gimmicks or trick questions, I promise!</span></p><h2><span id=Why_Did_I_Fail_My_Assessment_Test_At_Walmart><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Why Did I Fail My Assessment Test At Walmart?</span></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The biggest reason why most applicants fail their assessment test is that they simply aren’t prepared. Also, they don’t realize the importance of this test and how much weight it carries for your application process.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>So, let’s take a look at what you can do if your six months are up and you are ready to&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>apply for a second time for a Walmart Job</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;or want to apply and do well the first time.</span></p><h2><span id=How_Can_I_Better_Prepare_Myself_For_This_Assessment><span data-preserver-spaces=true>How Can I Better Prepare Myself For This Assessment?</span></span></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/How-Can-I-Better-Prepare-Myself-For-This-Assessment.png alt="How Can I Better Prepare Myself For This Assessment?" width=1200 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>There is a lot you can do to better&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>prepare yourself for your&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Walmart Application</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;and assessment</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For starters, you need to make sure you have researched and have a really good understanding of the role you are applying for.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>You can also do a lot of online sample questions. These are great as they are usually more problem-solving-based. If this is your first time&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>working in a store like Walmart</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, you might not have much experience in all these areas, so it’s a great way to learn. Both for the assessment but also if you are successful in your application!</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>There is also some online training available, which will help educate you for your assessments.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Walmart has fixed benchmarks that apply to each individual position that must be met. Therefore these tests help HR sort through the suitability of potential candidates and narrow down numbers for interviews.</span></p><h2><span id=What_Is_The_Walmart_Application_Process><span data-preserver-spaces=true>What Is The Walmart Application Process?</span></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The application and employment process at Walmart is completed in five steps.</span></p><li><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Application</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Online Assessment</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Interview</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Pre-Employment Checks</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Orientation</span></li><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Let’s take a look at these in a bit more detail…</span></p><h3><span id=Application><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Application</span></span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>You’ll need to complete the online application, which usually takes around 45-60 minutes.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Depending on which role you are applying for. You might have to submit extra documents like a cover letter or a full CV detailing your previous employment and skills.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For more information, take a look at our in-depth guide to the&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Walmart Application</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.</span></p><h3><span id=Online_Assessments><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Online Assessments</span></span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In some cases, you’ll be invited via email to&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>complete the Walmart Assessment Test</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;as soon as you’ve submitted your application. This allows your application and scores from the test to be reviewed together to determine your suitability for the role.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In other instances, you should hear back from the team within a week if they are impressed by your application. You’ll then be asked to complete the Walmart Assessment and possibly one or more others.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>If you fail the assessment, then your application process finishes. You will be able to reapply in six months’ time. If you pass this assessment, you will move on to the third stage, which is a face-to-face interview.</span></p><h3><span id=Interview><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Interview</span></span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Potential-Walmart-Interview-Questions.png alt="Potential Walmart Interview Questions" width=1200 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>If you have impressed the company with your application and online assessments, you’ll then be invited for an interview.

Also, make sure you arrive early so that you are not rushed or late due to unforeseen circumstances.
