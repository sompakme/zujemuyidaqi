The following begins with her trampling a&nbsp;"Re-elect Trump" sign - after which she exclaims, "Well, you guys aren’t fans of our show, and we don’t want you to be fans of our show."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Then for some reason, a couple of police officers tasked with "crowd control" inform Moore that she was unlucky to come out unscathed. "You could’ve died for Trump! He could’ve stabbed you!"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The video in question was submitted to Facebook by a known Trump supporter going by the name of Dion Cini. Their social networking profile clearly notes their allegiances by way of photographic evidence, namely photos where they've shown face at Trump rallies with "Blue Lives Matter" signage and rhetoric.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Cini, who ostensibly filmed everything from a bird's eye view, later pressed charges against Indya Moore on the grounds that she disfigured a poster that cost well over $250 to fabricate. For her part, Moore thanked her fans for the immediate support she received in the advent of video being posted on social media this afternoon. It doesn't seem as though Moore will face charges for larceny, or anything for that matter. Fingers crossed on all fronts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhboJ3f5Jmp6irlWKupMDRnqqsZZmjsbqtjKamqKqVYrCtrdKhnKxlp57BqXnTq6ymqF2owrG8zqurnqqjYravecyapaGZpKmur3nNnq6s</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
