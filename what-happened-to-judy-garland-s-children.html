Though Lorna refers to her childhood as "idyllic," by the time she reached the age of 12, she became aware of her mother's struggles and had to process Garland's divorce from her father. Following her mother's death in 1969, Luft also chose to pursue both a singing and acting career, going on to star in films like "<a href=#>Grease 2</a>" and "<a href=#>My Giant</a>."&nbsp;She&nbsp; met and married rocker John Hooker in 1977, and had two children before divorcing. Luft is now remarried and has four grandchildren, with the newest addition being born in March of 2022&nbsp;(per "<a href=#>Today</a>").</p><p>Luft has suffered a few medical setbacks in the last decade. She was diagnosed with breast cancer and had surgeries to remove it in 2012 and 2015. She was then diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2018. She has had that tumor successfully removed as well, per <a href=#>Refinery 29</a>. Though she has not achieved the success of her mother or half-sister, she did write a book about her family in 1998 titled "<a href=#>Me and My Shadows: A Family Memoir</a>." Despite her own battle with cocaine during the '70s and '80s, she is now drug-free and published another book in 2019, titled "<a href=#>A Star Is Born: Judy Garland and the Film That Got Away</a>."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDkWlnbW9frLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSjrZSueqit0aWYp5yjYrCptcudqZ6mXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
