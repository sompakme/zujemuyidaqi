And when&nbsp;Italian fashion house, <a class=hm-link href=#>Valentino</a>, announced that they would be dressing Jennifer again for the Academy Awards 2013, wedding watchers began to talk of the lady in red turning white with <strong>Valentino Garavini</strong> for the awaited&nbsp;wedding day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5204ac4c34d2-jen-scars-z.jpg><p id=e6WE9zeINK57></p><p id=eBKCYDCaMYTW data-wc=144>Stepping out in the vivacious coloured <strong>taffeta ballgown</strong> hot from the catwalks of the designer's Spring 2013 collection, there was no sign of pre-wedding jitters as Jennifer and Justin arrived at the Oscars ceremony looking relaxed and happy. Whilst the actress, who shot to fame for her role in has said before that she likes "classic, elegant designers such as Lanvin", <strong>Valentino</strong> has remained a firm favourite with&nbsp;Jennifer&nbsp;and has often been her go-to red carpet choice. A fan of <strong>neutral and nude colours</strong> it's unlikely that this bride will be opting for anything as bold as her awards ceremony number but may go for something with a touch of sparkle. Often seen in glittering form-fitting designs, the &nbsp;star also made fashion headlines in 2009 for another Oscars number by Valentino as she dazzled in a full-length embellished gown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a0b759da34ca-jennifer-aniston-z.jpg><p id=eUF7pfxHJ3XF data-wc=170>Jennifer, 44, similarly opted for a princess-like beaded wedding dress when she wed actor <a class=hm-link href=#>Brad Pitt</a> in a lavish ceremony during July, 2000. And whilst the odds are low that the actress will choose <strong>Lawrence Steele</strong>, who created the low-back dress, again for big day with <strong>Justin Theroux</strong> there's no dispute that Jennifer loves an outfit that shimmers. It's just as unlikely that Jennifer and Justin will go to the hairdressers for matching 'dos as the bride-to-be had done with ex-husband Brad – who both sported blonde highlighted hair at their Malibu cliff-top affair. We can, however, predict that the Californian-born star's <strong>wedding day style</strong> will stay true to form with her usual beachy look. A bridal gown in ivory would show off Jennifer's honey-gold tan perfectly whilst a asymmetrical or strapless cut is likely as the actress is fond of showing off her lithe, toned arms. Topped off with her trademark tousled tresses and minimal make-up, we're sure that <strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong> is going to look simply stunning on the big day!</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
