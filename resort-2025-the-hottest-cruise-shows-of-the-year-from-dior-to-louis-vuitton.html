Originating in the mid-20th century to cater to wealthy clients vacationing in warm climates during winter, these collections feature lighter fabrics, vibrant colours, and playful prints that are perfect for holidays and travel. Cruise collections hit stores early, offering new styles ahead of the main seasons, and are designed with a global clientele in mind.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-gid=eYeSPkHW5zY data-wc=22>Where do Cruise shows take place?</h2><p data-wc=49 id=eT-HI8dheo>Luxury fashion houses often host Cruise shows in culturally significant locations, blending travel and the collection in a glamorous setting. This tradition allows designers to explore different themes and provide consumers with fresh options year-round. This of course makes Cruise shows a highly anticipated event in the fashion calendar.</p><h2 data-wc=22>Your Guide To The 2025 Resort Shows:</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/0039e4a72f0c-valentino-resort-po-s25-007.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Valentino Cruise 2025</h2><p dir=ltr>Following Alessandro Michele’s appointment at Valentino two months ago, his first collection has been highly anticipated in the fashion sphere. Showcasing an astounding 171 looks and accompanied by 93 accessories, we saw an array of his signature whimsical, kitsch Alessandro Michele styles. Featuring retro prints, a combination of textures and extreme layering, we saw nods to archival 60’s and 70’s styles and silhouettes throughout and maximalist accessories in the form of gloves, oversized pearls and lace tights and socks. As he left Gucci, we were left wondering if he would bring his signature flair to Valentino, and so far he has. It will be interesting to see how he builds the new house codes for Valentino as time goes on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/fb09d3cbcbf5-max-mara-resort-s25-003.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Max Mara Cruise 2025</h2><p>Set in Venice in the Palazzo Ducale, where no fashion show has ever been granted access, Max Mara showcased their 60-look collection. Creative Director Ian Griffiths has been designing women's RTW for the brand for over 30 years, and it is still owned by the Maramotti family who founded it in 1951. Heritage, DNA and house codes reign strong for Max Mara, and this collection was no exception. Inspired by Marco Polo’s travels and trading adventures, we saw earthy tones with billowing sleeves, fringed belts, kaftans, sweeping cashmere coats and turbans in collaboration with milliner Stephen Jones. As the show drew to a close, the final four looks presented were replicas of the designer's degree collection from 40 years ago in Manchester.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/89ff1b5949f5-versace-resort-po-s25-002.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Versace Cruise 2025</h2><p>As a house that doesn’t do subtlety, Versace’s resort collection embodied Dontalla Versace’s young heart. In May, she was awarded an Order of Merit of the Italian Republic from the President of Italy for her contributions to Italian fashion and culture, one of the country's highest honours. This season, Versace took traditional wardrobe capsules and added their signature spice to it: leopard print coats with matching knee-high boots, a pink shearling lined coat and skirt two-piece set, a vibrant lipstick red riding jacket paired with stirrups and stiletto boots. With a preppy, punk feel packed with vibrant colours and prints, this collection gives a young rebel attitude.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/ae370a34c8b3-zimmermann-resort-po-s25-025.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Zimmermann Cruise 2025</h2><p>Australian label Zimmermann took inspo from 80’s films such as The Breakfast Club and Rose Candy for their resort collection. Inspired by the styles of Winona Ryder and Molly Ringwald, their fresh and modern take on style classics from the era shone through. With soft floral prints, pastel hues, lace textures and high-waisted denim, their suits and biker jackets have a more masculine edge to them. Their jewellery consisted of Zimmermann’s signature oversized, statement pieces with a more feminine feel to them, combining the two aspects of the collection and giving it a contrasting finish.<br></p><p id=epF6VKqm3ag></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/78d7260100b6-gettyimages-2155323619.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Dior Cruise 2025</h2><p>Dior's Cruise show was a fashion fairy tale set in the enchanting gardens of Scotland's Drummond Castle. The runway was flanked by manicured hedges and blooming flowers, with models that appeared as if they just stepped out of a storybook. Maria Grazia Chiuri's designs were a perfect blend of past and future, paying homage to Dior's historic ties with the country and "when Christian Dior presented the spring-summer 1955 silhouettes at the Gleneagles Hotel," the brand explained in an official statement. Majestic puff-sleeved gowns fit for a modern-day princess, and edgy tartan skirts were paired with leather jackets for a rock-and-roll vibe. Intricate embroidery and sparkling embellishments added a touch of highland-bling to each look, echoing the grandeur of the castle itself.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/693d2e7dbcbf-chanel057le-corbusier-unite-dhabitation-marseille-copyright-flc-adagp-paris-20.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Chanel Cruise 2025</h2><p>The Chanel Cruise show was a splashy delight, held in the vibrant and breezy city of Marseille. Virginie Viard took us on an seaside escapade, blending chic with a hint of aquatic adventure. "The sun, architecture, music and dance: Marseille also has a very strong sense of freedom," she explained, and it showed. The collection featured wetsuits-inspired pieces, jackets with diving hoods and press studs, starting with an aniseed-green Chanel suit that screams '60s nostalgia. Dresses flaunted fish nets, and shell motifs, making it feel like a chic mermaid's wardrobe. Tweeds and jerseys in vibrant hues and geometric patterns, inspired by the city's architecture. Even the classic sweatshirt got a chic makeover with fish-printed chiffon and kangaroo pockets. Footwear? Platform terry towelling flip-flops, of course.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/d35a210a38c4-gettyimages-2152811793.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Gucci Cruise 2025</h2><p>Gucci's Cruise show at London's Tate Modern was a glorious nod to the city's eclectic charm and the brand's storied past. The collection, masterminded by Sabato De Sarno, was a love letter to London, capturing its essence with 70s flair. Kicking off with oversized blazers and baggy jeans, the collection screamed casual cool, perfect for strutting down the cobbled streets of Camden. Retro vibes came through with mini skirts and hot pants paired with chic scarves, channeling a bit of '60s mod magic. There were rich leather suits in deep burgundy, adding a touch of rock 'n' roll edge, and delicate lace dresses that felt like they stepped out of Kate Moss' vintage cupboard. The show wasn't just about clothes; it was a green revolution. Gucci teamed up with , turning the Tate Modern into a lush botanical haven with 10,000 plants destined to transform Maxilla Gardens into a community oasis.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/39950552c422-gyg0421.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Louis Vuitton Cruise 2025</h2><p>Held in Barcelona’s iconic Park Güell Louis Vuitton's Cruise show was nothing short of a fashion fiesta. Models strutted down the runway with the swagger of Gaudí himself, rocking oversized blazers that meant business, sassy shorts, and skirts that twirled like they’re dancing flamenco. The looks were topped off with wide-brimmed hats and statement shades cooler than an ice-cold sangria. The collection was a playful parade of neutrals and bold bursts of colour, a nod to Spain's vivacious spirit. The set, designed by James Chinlund, had seats winding around Gaudí’s whimsical mosaics. It was Louis Vuitton’s love letter to Spain, mixing tradition with a modern twist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/1c4c5b25b9bb-large-sp25runwayimageslook56-flfeic2000x3000.jpg><h2 class="GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g hm-heading">Balenciaga Cruise 2025</h2><p>Balenciaga's Cruise show in Shanghai was a bold and unforgettable spectacle. Demna showcased his visionary style at the Museum of Art Pudong, marking his striking debut in the vibrant city. The collection opened with sky-high platform boots, modelled by Thai superstar PP Krit Amnuaydechkorn, emphasising the brand's commitment to chunky footwear. Demna's signature silhouettes - razor-sharp heels, and asymmetrical shirting - were on full display, complemented by oversized coats, trenches, and blazers.&nbsp;</p><p>The event was infused with Shanghai's electric energy, and Balenciaga-themed xiao long baos added to the unique experience.
