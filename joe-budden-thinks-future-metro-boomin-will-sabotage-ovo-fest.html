He's been chronicling the feud between <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Future</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Metro Boomin</a> on his podcast, and he thinks the next chess moves will be made on the road. The former rapper theorized that Future and Metro Boomin will purposely schedule their tour in an effort to ruin the attendance for Drake's upcoming OVO fest in Toronto. He went as far as to say that the duo will enlist the help of another Canadian superstar, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>The Weeknd</a>, to drive the point home.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Budden noticed that Future and Metro's Toronto date may line up with the same weekend as OVO Fest. If true, he's confident Drake will push the date back. "If The Weeknd comes out on that Future tour stop," he noted. "I have Drake moving that weekend. He's moving the weekend." The rest of the podcast panel hated Budden's theory. Regardless, he stood his ground. "This wouldn't be the first time he moved OVO fest," he added. "I don't think there's any shame in that when you spend as much money and as much manpower to put this weekend together."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-joe-budden-thinks-drake-will-push-back-ovo-fest>Joe Budden Thinks Drake Will Push Back OVO Fest</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Joe Budden insisted that The Weeknd was the key artist in this game of concert chicken. He believes if the "Starboy" singer shows up to the Future show, it will take the wind out of Drake's sails. His rationale is that Weeknd is a bigger artist. "I would think that the second day of OVO Fest has a greater turnout the day there's not a Future show," he posited. "Cuse that's a weekend. That's a whole weekend."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The feud between these artists is not letting up. Firstly, Future and Metro dropped the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Like That" remix</a> with more Drake disses. Secondly, The Weeknd crooned a few disses on the duo's song "All to Myself." Future also guested on Nardo Wick's "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Back to Back</a>," which saw him mock Drake using his own song titles. It's safe to assume these artists will be performing their diss records in Toronto. If Drake does decided to move forward with OVO fest the same weekend, however, fans will be forced to pick sides. Things could get messy. To use Joe Budden's own words: "let's see."</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Danilo is a writer based out of San Diego.
