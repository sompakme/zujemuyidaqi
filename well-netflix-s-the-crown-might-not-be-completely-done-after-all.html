The original series spanned six seasons and seven years, from 2016 to 2023, but this iteration would see new installments of the show in bite-size helpings, the outlet reports. Tatler said the success of Scoop, released on April 5, showed there was still interest in singular moments in time when it comes to the British royal family.&nbsp;</p><p>“If they can repeat that pattern by delivering prequels in a shorter form, they believe they may have come up with a winning formula for a new incarnation of The Crown,” a source said.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gxwbB2k5LFkKPgPqfmTYMK-1920-80.jpg><p>The first royal reportedly being considered is Edward VII, also known as Bertie—the eldest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and the great-grandfather of Queen <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/queen-elizabeth-ii/>Elizabeth II</a>. (Not to be confused with her father, who was also nicknamed Bertie.) Edward VII took the throne in 1901 and was embroiled in numerous scandals throughout his life—and gained a reputation as a playboy prince and the nickname “Dirty Bertie.” (Yikes.) He died at age 68 “due to health issues brought on by his copious smoking,” Tatler writes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/utLwixCarWZzhZvhdMPmeg-1920-80.jpg><p>Though early seasons of The Crown were met with critical acclaim and high praise, later seasons drew ample controversy over historical accuracy. “When the sixth season was released at the end of 2023, some breathed a sigh of relief, thinking the controversial show had been put to bed for good,” Tatler reports.

Characters were introduced into the story who could not have been there, dead people were portrayed as still living. I pointed out these errors, thinking I was catching the filmmakers out—that they had done shoddy homework and made silly errors. These they most certainly had. What I did not realize was the truth seems to have been of no interest to them at all. They were only interested in drama, and they obtained it in many devious ways.”</p><p>In particular, “There has been extensive criticism that no disclaimer appeared at the beginning of each episode to make it clear that we were watching fictional versions of real-life happenings,” Vickers continued. “They refused to add one.”</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
