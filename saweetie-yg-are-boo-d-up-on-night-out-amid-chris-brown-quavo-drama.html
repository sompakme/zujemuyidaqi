Moreover, they recently went on a club outing for one of Power 106's anniversary parties on Thursday night (April 25). While it's obviously impossible to assume their attitudes, mental spaces, and moods with just one clip, it seems like they were at least relaxed and just happy to be there. Whether or not they're actually worrying about this situation or whether it's caused a bump on their journey, they're certainly not letting the cameras find out.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, for those unaware, Saweetie actually responded to Quavo mentioning that he can turn any model into her by <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">posting a screenshot of an alleged DM that the former Migo sent her</a> back in January, which she still hadn't opened. He hasn't responded to this move publicly at press time, and we wonder whether or not he thought that his bars would come across as more defensive than mocking. Regardless, she hasn't really said much about Chris Brown and about how he claimed to have slept with her while she was with Quavo in the first place, opening up this whole can of worms. This is all mostly speculative, but you can start to see where the tea really gets interesting in this whole debacle.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-saweetie-amp-yg-party-through-chris-brown-amp-quavo-drama>Saweetie & YG Party Through Chris Brown & Quavo Drama</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Of course, there's a good chance that the Icy Girl will respond to some of this on <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">her upcoming single</a>, which she has teased quite heavily and much to fan excitement. After all, she recently suggested that she might rewrite some bars for it while this whole beef between Quavo and Chris Brown was heating up with diss tracks and responses. No matter how Saweetie chooses to handle this moving forward, YG's seemingly got her back. But we know that things can change quickly, especially behind closed doors that we can't peep behind just yet.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For example, this couple were recently <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the subject of breakup rumors</a> themselves, so we can only wish them the best moving forward.
