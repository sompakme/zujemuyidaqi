Rumor has it the two started dating shortly after their first meeting. The pair married two years later on April 4, 1987. At first, the couple had zero aspirations of becoming pastors, but after much cajoling by his father, Joel Osteen finally decided to take the leap into preaching the gospel and Victoria quickly followed suit.</p><p>In a 2017 interview with <a href=#>Get Up! Mornings</a>, Victoria opened up to host Erica Campbell about the couple's transition into ministry work and described it as a "whole new ball game."&nbsp;She went on to add, "When we married, we weren't pastors. We were just two young people... We have grown together and learned together, and really learned how to love people together."&nbsp;Victoria described their experience as "a beautiful place to be," as well as "something [she] didn't expect when [she] got married." After all this time together, she said, "I'm still crazy about my husband after 30 years. I respect him, I honor him."</p><p>As for their secret to a successful marriage, Victoria shared, "We carve out time for each other." She added that&nbsp;they've always been "family-oriented," including when it comes to staying close with their two children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2tlaYF4e9Wimq2nop6ubrvSrZyepl2ptaZ506usraBdlq%2BwwdNmoaidnGK8tMDEnqWsZaees6Z7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
