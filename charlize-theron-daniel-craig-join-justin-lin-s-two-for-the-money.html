Lin and Mazeau came up with the idea for the project during their time on the 10th installment and then pitched Theron, who was part of the sprawling Fast cast. The actress fell for the story’s Cary Grant-Rosalind Russell snappy rapport vibe and suggested that Craig be her guy Friday. Lin famously <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>did not go on to direct</a> Fast X and after exiting, focused on a more personal project. When that got far enough along and after the film was released in May, the team refocused on the heist thriller. &nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Two for the Money continues to build upon Apple’s high-profile, high-wattage film slate. The studio is in the awards conversation with Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon, which is already garnering wins, and has Ridley Scott’s Napoleon, starring Joaquin Phoenix, in theaters as well. Next up is Matthew Vaughn’s star-jammed spy thriller Argylle. It is also in production on a Formula 1 feature starring Brad Pitt.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">For Perfect Storm, Two for the Money is the biggest sale and project yet to be set up by Lin and his president, Andrew Schneider. The latter executive added film to his purview at the beginning of the year, and the two have been working on laying out the road map for Lin’s post-Fast future. That includes Lin returning to his indie roots by directing The Last Days of John Allen Chau, which will shoot in Thailand in early 2024.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Theron next stars in <a href=# id=auto-tag_the-old-guard-2_1 data-tag=the-old-guard-2>The Old Guard 2</a>, which Netflix will release in 2024. Craig last appeared leading the cast of Rian Johnson’s Glass Onion. Mazeau, meanwhile, wrote Damsel, the upcoming <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fantasy starring Millie Bobby Brown</a> that will also hit Netflix next year.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Theron is repped by CAA and Hansen Jacobson, while Craig is repped by&nbsp;CAA, Independent Talent in the U.K. and Glaser Weil.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Justin Lin&nbsp;and Perfect Storm are repped by CAA and Sloane Offer, while Mazeau is repped by&nbsp;CAA,&nbsp;Leigh Hill Management and&nbsp;Katz Golden.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKS0wKujorKVYsGpsdGopWackaO2priMnKmaoZdit7a%2F06KlZqSZo3q1w85mnaiqXam1pnnMqKWesV1mf3SBlmtsb3BgZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
