Maxwell is now the AEW World Champion and does everything he can to put himself over. He also had a brawl with Samoa Joe at AEW All Out and it appears Adam Cole addressed it as well.</p><p>When Samoa Joe made his way to the ring during All Out, he passed MJF after he and Adam Cole successfully defended their ROH Tag Team Titles against The Dark Order. Joe shoved MJF on the ramp, which was a&nbsp;<a href=#>homage to what he did seven years go during an NXT TakeOver event in Brooklyn</a>.</p><p>This led to MJF brawling with Samoa Joe to the ring until the two had to be separated. While speaking during a<a href=#> digital Exclusive following AEW All Out</a>, Adam Cole talked about MJF and Samoa Joe’s brawl. Cole admitted that MJF got a little ahead of himself in that encounter.</p><p>”Max gets a little ahead of himself sometimes. As we were on our way to go check on the doctor, to go get Max checked out, Samoa Joe decides to make a statement. Samoa Joe decides to push Maxwell Jacob Friedman. Of course, Max can’t control himself. Max, you are one of the best pro wrestlers in the world. Sometimes, it’s so important that a guy like me is there to remind you, sometimes you gotta play it smart. Sometimes, you gotta play things a little safe. Max will be back to 100% in no time, I can promise you that. I’m excited, I’m elated to be one-half of the Ring of Honor World Tag Team Champions. But right now, I’m concerned for my friend, so I appreciate your time, but I’m gonna go check on my best friend.”</p><p>We will have to wait and see whether MJF and Samoa Joe will eventually end up feuding somewhere down the line, as fans would love to see the two feud in the future.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Did you enjoy Samoa Joe’s homage to that classic shoving spot?
