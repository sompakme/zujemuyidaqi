The story follows a couple whose seemingly idyllic family life is thrown into turmoil when their son starts acting out of character. At Starve Acre, their remote family home, archaeologist Richard buries himself in exploring a folkloric myth that the ancient oak tree on their land is imbued with phenomenal powers. While Juliette turns to the local community to find some kind of peace, Richard obsessively digs deeper. An unexpected discovery soon occupies the couple’s attention and dark and sinister forces, unwittingly allowed into the home, offer a disturbing possibility of reconnection between them.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">A House Productions film, Starve Acre was produced by Tessa Ross, Juliette Howell, Derrin Shlesinger and Emma Duffy.
