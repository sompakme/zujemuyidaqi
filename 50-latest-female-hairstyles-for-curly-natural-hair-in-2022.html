Please reach us through info@corp.legit.ng!</p><p class=align-left>There are different styles of hair that people with naturally curly hair can wear. Three or two-stranded braids have existed for years and are unlikely to run out of fashion. Many ladies prefer the braided look because it is low maintenance and is easy to style.</p><p class=align-left>If you want a fun look, you can have rainbow braids installed. There is a wide array of coloured extensions to choose from, so you can choose your favourite colours. If you want a toned-down look, you can mix two cool colours. You can also use ombre extensions for a cool and fashionable look.</p><p class=align-left>Another trending look is Fulani braids, where regular braids are accessorised with beads. Braids are versatile, so you can choose among jumbo, midi, and tiny sizes. Beware that the smaller your hair is sectioned, the longer you will spend in the salon. If you are looking for a protective look, you can have box braids installed using the <a href=#>feed-in style</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/aec5915155d04e60.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Spot your Favourite Celebs who Celebrated Africa Day at the #Africadayconcert2022</span></p></a><h3>Latest kinky hairstyles in Nigeria in 2022</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f4373be4f66d0a8d.png><p class=align-left>Many women find themselves looking at photos of ladies' hairstyles online. Among the commonly viewed looks are the kinky ones. These are installed using kinky extensions that have a coarse feel compared to regular extensions.</p><p class=align-left>These extensions are preferred because their texture feels closer to <a href=#>natural African hair</a>. Besides, they are versatile and can be worn to work, social functions, or other places. Like regular extensions, kinky extensions are available in multiple colours. They can be installed as three-stranded braids or twists and in different sizes and lengths.</p><h3>Crochet hairstyles for girls in Nigeria</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/aec5915155d04e60.jpg><p class=align-left>Crocheted hair has been trending in the last few years. Many women prefer this style because it takes a short period to instal, and it protects the hairline from traction alopecia. Qualified and experienced hairdressers weave the extensions into your natural hair without manipulating it too much.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/cf97f12d952bf172.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>40 ideas for knotless braid hairstyles to wear and be trendy in 2024</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The technique used to instal these looks is somewhat similar to that used when creating blankies and sweaters. A latch hook is used to achieve the above looks. Usually, the finished product resembles loose waves or curls, which are always fashionable.</p><h3>Feed-in female hairstyles</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d96c9d045370099e.png><p class=align-left>In recent years, women have become more concerned about traction alopecia, or receding hairlines caused by over manipulation. This has caused a rise in the demand for protective styles, including the feed-in technique.</p><p class=align-left>The beautiful looks above are achieved the same way regular cornrows are. However, the difference is that in feed-in looks, a starter braid is created with your natural hair, and then synthetic extensions are added gradually to create a long cornrow.</p><p class=align-left>Feed-in braids are a favourable option if you want some time away from having to style your daily look. They are low maintenance and look stunning.</p><h3>Cornrow hairstyles for ladies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5992cab5a6c6f8f9.png><p class=align-left>Cornrows are another versatile style that is unlikely to go out of fashion.

You can <a href=#>use coloured extensions</a> for a bold look. You can also have the traditional straight-back or straight-up looks. Beware that cornrows can cause traction alopecia, especially if they are tightly done. You can prevent this by wearing looser braids and changing your look every two or three months.</p><h3>Natural and simple hairstyles for ladies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/cf97f12d952bf172.png><p class=align-left>In the contemporary <a href=#>world</a>, many women, especially Africans, are embracing their naturally curly hair. Natural looks can be worn to places of work today as people are embracing them more. In the past, these looks were perceived as shaggy or unkempt for offices, but this fallacious notion has changed over the years.</p><p class=align-left>These looks simply involve wearing one's natural hair and are ideal for those with thick hair. Alternatively, you can wear extensions or wigs with the same texture as your natural hair.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/30bb1181efb69626.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Celebrity fashionista: 8 beautiful times Laura Ikeji proved to be a stylish mum</span></p></a><h3>Beautiful hairstyles for ladies and little girls</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a2e7c6eb2da12691.png><p class=align-left>Finding appropriate looks for little girls can be challenging because many young kids would rather not spend too much time at the salon.
