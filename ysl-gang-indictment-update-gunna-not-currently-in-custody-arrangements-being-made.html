During a press conference on Tuesday, May 10th, officials confirmed that the "Pushin P" hitmaker's reps are making arrangements with the Sheriff.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While details at this time remain sparse, they shared that "the short answer is, he's not in custody." When a journalist asked if the 28-year-old recording artist has expressed any interest in surrendering, authorities confirmed, "We're making arrangements, as much as he had representatives call me last night directly."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/79/79/887979_d3e9eb49a66a7da114b507564b1a9b9e.jpg><p><h6>Marcus Ingram/Getty Images</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"We'll muddle through that piece and let you know," they said of Gunna's situation.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">During the same press conference, the Fulton County DA made it clear that the&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">prosecution will be seeking life sentences</a> for "many" of 28 people named in the 56-count indictment. "We’ll ask on the different charges for the maximum penalties, and there are obviously many people that are looking at life under this indictment," she shared.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"You’re absolutely right. These are serious crimes, they’re serious allegations, and it is my opinion that violence in our community deserves maximum penalties."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While Gunna's fate remains unclear, we do know that <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Young Thug</a> has been taken into custody; footage has been circulating online of his arrest, including clips of police raiding the 30-year-old's Buckhead home.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Thugger's charges are more severe than his frequent collaborators. The YSL head is "facing charges of participating in street gang activity and conspiring to violate RICO," and has also been accused of "renting 2014 Infiniti Q50 sedan... which was used in the commission of the murder of Donovan Thomas, Jr., a rival gang member."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p>About The Author</p><p>Hayley Hynes is the former Weekend Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop, she stepped down after two years in 2024 to pursue other creative opportunities but remains on staff part-time to cover music, gossip, and pop culture news.
