However, according to a source speaking to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Entertainment Tonight</a>, things are about to become an international affair. Swift is set to resume her Eras Tour, bringing the show to Europe and South America, and, if the source is to be believed, Travis could be coming along for the ride. Coincidentally, the Kansas City Chiefs have a bye week the same weekend as Swift's shows in Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Travis and Taylor are all in. The two are very into each other and are enjoying their time together but are also planning for the future. Taylor starts her international tour in November, and Travis is planning to be there to spend time with her," the source shared. "Travis and Taylor are very serious about their careers, and the two bond over that and want to show support for each other whenever they can."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Tammy Ljungblad/Kansas City Star/Tribune News Service via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Taylor is scheduled to headline three nights in Buenos Aires at Estadio Monumental, from Nov. 9 to 11. The venue has played host to the 1978 Soccer World Cup and names like Madonna and Michael Jackson. That's also week 10 of the NFL season and thanks to a bye week that the Chiefs have been afforded, Kelce could jet south of the equator to support Swift's international endeavors. However, there's no confirmation of his travel plans just yet, so Swifties and Kelce stans will have to watch the VIP suites at her show, much like NFL fans are keeping watch for her in the stands every time the Chiefs take to the turf.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">ET&nbsp;also adds that Kelce is looking for some new real estate in Kansas City, as his current home is accessible to the public and he wants to step up security measures in case Swift wants to hang out away from the prying lenses of the paparazzi. Kelce spoke about the newfound attention that his relationship is bringing to the league and his life, though he wasn't upset about any of it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I embrace it,"&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>he said in an interview</a>&nbsp;with Taylor Rooks last week. "I love the chaos. Knowing everybody is looking at the Kansas City Chiefs, and then you add in all the madness that's happening out here in the world, and it's a whole bunch of fun for me right now."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5706uYr6GjYrimuMKeZKCnmaO0bsDOZquasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWVp660edOorKtlmaPBpr7Nmquip56WuW6wwK2crGVoaIN6fZRy</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
