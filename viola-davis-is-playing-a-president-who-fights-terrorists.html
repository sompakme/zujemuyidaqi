Club</a> reported that Davis has been tapped to play a fictional US President who goes up against terrorists in the <a href=#>Prime Video</a> thriller G20. Davis will also be producing the film with Patricia Riggen directing.</p><p>Viola Davis will play American President Taylor Sutton, who uses her political and military experience to protect her family and fellow leaders when terrorists take over the G20 summit. The script was penned by Noah and Logan Miller with revisions by Caitlin Parrish and Erica Weiss. Along with Amazon Studios, MRC Film is also developing the film.</p><p>It looks like Viola Davis is getting accustomed to playing leaders, as she recently starred in the film <a href=#>The Woman King</a>, which saw her play General Nanisca, a woman who an all-female regime of warriors in the African Kingdom of Dahomey. The Woman King is based on true events and the real-life female warrior unit the Agojie, which also inspired Black Panther’s Dora Milaje. The Woman King is directed by Gina Price-Bythewood and also stars Thuso Mbedu, Lashana Lynch, Sheila Atim, and John Boyega.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/viola-davis-the-woman-king-900x600.jpg><p>Viola Davis also briefly reprised her role as the DCEU’s director of A.R.G.U.S. Amanda Waller in Black Adam. We also saw her reprise the role of Amanda Waller in 2022’s first season of Peacemaker after playing the character in both of the Suicide Squad films. With James Gunn now in charge of DC Films going forward, it seems more and more likely that we’ll also get that <a href=#>Amanda Waller spin-off</a> series sooner than later.</p><p>While there’s no clear release date for Viola Davis’ upcoming President movie for Prime Video, we won’t have to wait too long to see her in another project. Not only is The Woman King currently playing in various theaters, but she’ll also be starring in the film that follows the story of Nike signing Michael Jordan. Viola Davis will be playing Michael Jordan’s mother, Deloris Jordan in the film.</p><p>Ben Affleck will direct and team up with Matt Damon once again to co-write and co-star in the Nike film. Ben Affleck will be playing Nike co-founder Phil Knight while Damon plays salesman Sonny Vaccaro, the man who signed Jordan to the shoe brand. Along with Viola Davis, Damon, and Affleck, the film also stars Jason Bateman, Marlon Wayans, Gustaf Skarsgard, Chris Messina, Chris Tucker, and Julius Tennon.</p><p>There’s no word on when we’ll get to see Viola Davis in the Nike project yet, but we do know we should expect to see Davis in the Hunger Games prequel film on November 17, 2023. <a href=#>The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</a> will follow a young Coriolanus Snow as he mentors a female District 12 tribute for the 10th Hunger Games. The Francis Lawrence-directed The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes will also star Tom Blyth, Rachel Zegler, Hunter Schafer, Peter Dinklage, Isobel Jesper Jones, Burn Gorman, and Jason Schwartzman.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iumaS5onnDmq2iq12lv6a%2FyJ2cp6xdlrqixs6nZKBqYGO1tbnL</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
