However, both the hotel and film industries rely on putting on a show and the couple, who juggle the business with their TV and film projects and are often found on their laptops sitting at the bar, are aware of the glamour and intrigue their respective jobs add to the place – as well as some of the guests.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7c77b1a38eab-foresters-hall-xmas.jpg><p id=eDfxYO19Jff data-wc=27>Famous faces who have stayed include The Queen’s Gambit and Love Actually actor Thomas Brodie-Sangster with his actress fiancée Talulah Riley, and musician and presenter Jarvis Cocker.</p><p id=eemcV8ZfXti data-wc=69>"A lot of people are quite taken with the film stuff – they love talking to Peter and me about it," says Sara, who is currently working on a BBC drama about the 1988 Lockerbie disaster, to be screened next year. "What we realised is that if you love wine, love food, love design, love art, love people, it’s a wonderful way to exist," says Peter of the hotel.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5d9734e3f764-hotel.jpg><p id=e4bGyYm0ICD data-wc=22>"And we’re fortunate enough that we can run it – as I half-jokingly say – somewhere between a hobby and a business."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/82e07fea9fa1-t-image-foresters.jpg><p id=eCM1mMQpWbZ data-wc=34>He has enjoyed significant success as a producer, with Schitt’s Creek&nbsp;being the jewel in his crown, having known the show’s co-creator and leading actor, Canadian comedian Eugene Levy, for more than 35 years.&nbsp;</p><p id=ew0o2AbxJdq data-wc=69>"It was never meant to be a worldwide phenomena," he says. "In the history of US television, no show, not M*A*S*H, Cheers, Friends, Seinfeld, no show has achieved at the Emmys what Schitt’s Creek&nbsp;did.
