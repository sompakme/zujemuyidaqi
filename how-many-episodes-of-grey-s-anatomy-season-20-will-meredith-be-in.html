Reps for ABC declined to comment.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">As previously announced, Pompeo was not expected to have much — if any — of an onscreen role in the Shonda Rhimes-produced drama’s landmark 20th season. Pompeo was reduced from series regular to recurring after signing on to produce and star in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">limited series for Hulu</a>. That show, which remains untitled, is currently in pre-production.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In season 19, Pompeo appeared in less than 10 of the 20 episodes and was written out in the finale after moving to Boston. The actress, who has starred as the Grey in Grey’s Anatomy since 2005, is expected to continue to do her trademark voiceover for the show. Pompeo’s appearance in a teaser trailer for season 20 also generated headlines as sources say she has a big storyline that is set up in the upcoming premiere.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">As for other season 20 tidbits, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/greys-anatomy-jessica-capshaw-returns-season-20-1235821597/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Jessica Capshaw will reprise her role</a> as Arizona in what sources say will be just one episode.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Season 20 will consist of only 10 episodes after last year’s dual strikes delayed production and dramatically impacted the broadcast schedule. The new season also marks the first for Meg Marinis&nbsp;as showrunner after <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/krista-vernoff-checks-out-as-showrunner-of-greys-anatomy-station-19-1235309927/>Krista Vernoff departed at the end of season 19</a>. Marinis has been with&nbsp;Grey’s Anatomy&nbsp;since its third season and has worked her way up since beginning her tenure there as a writer’s production assistant. She then worked as a writer’s assistant and medical researcher before moving up the chain of command to executive producer, a title she’s held for the past four seasons. Marinis has written more than 25 episodes of the show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOppyrnZSewal5xqucsmWVpba0u8OeqmafoprGtHnAp5itp52uerSxwKymp2ViZXqmuMuepWaon6K9pruMamlsbWhnfneFk2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
