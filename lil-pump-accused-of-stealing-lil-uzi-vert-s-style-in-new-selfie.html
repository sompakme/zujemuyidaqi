It looks like others may be following suit. In fact, if you've been keeping up with Lil Uzi Vert, you may have noticed a few pretty significant transformations in their life. Last year, the rapper publicly shared their identification with they/them pronouns, signaling a new non-binary direction. Following this announcement, Uzi released their EP, Red+White, featuring tracks like "Glock In My Purse," which further reflected their evolving identity.</p><p>In addition to these personal changes, Uzi has undergone notable physical alterations. This year, they debuted six new facial piercings. They also frequently sport a punk-inspired hairstyle. While Uzi previously showcased a <a href=# rel>diamond implant</a> on their forehead, it has since been removed. However, they have added permanent tongue and forehead tattoos. Recently, Uzi introduced a new alter ego named "Leslie," <a href=# rel>unveiling another facet of their artistic expression</a>. While Lil Uzi tends to go for a more punk style these days, Leslie is v<a href=# rel>ery much a scene/emo girl</a>.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-pump-biting-lil-uzi-s-style>Is Pump Biting Lil Uzi's Style?</h2></span><p><a href=# class=text-word rel>Lil Pump</a> has faced accusations of imitating Uzi's style with his recent change in appearance. On Mother's Day, the rapper shared a photo on Instagram showcasing a straight, jet black wig covering one side of his face, along with an all-black outfit. In the caption, he wished a happy Mother's Day to all the "beautiful moms." However, when RapTV reposted the picture on Instagram, many users took the opportunity to criticize Pump's eccentric new look, drawing comparisons to Lil Uzi Vert's emo-inspired aesthetic.</p><p>“Bro think he uzi,” one comment said. More chimed in to agree. “He’s been tryna copy uzi for 6 damn years now," said another user. In a slightly more dramatic statement, one fan thinks that Lil Pump is crossing the line. "He’s officially gone past the point of no return," they said. It would appear that many are not into Pump's new look. Uzi didn't invent the punk or emo aesthetic, but they have certainly been one of very few rappers that have leaned into it recently. Do you think Lil Pump is biting Uzi's style or are people overreacting?
