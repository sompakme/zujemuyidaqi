She would eventually leave WWE in 2014 and retire from professional wrestling. That said, it appears Kaitlyn doesn’t rule out making a return to the squared circle.</p><p>The former Diva’s Champion returned to professional wrestling back in 2017. <a href=#>She would go on to win the SlamForce Africa Women’s Championship</a> after defeating Katie Forbes and Black Widow. She still hasn’t competed in a match since 2019.</p><p>While speaking to <a href=#>Muscle Memory</a>, Kaitlyn was asked about making a return to the squared circle. The former WWE Superstar made it clear that she doesn’t rule out returning to in-ring competition in the future.</p><p>”I think with anything I am not 100% so against coming back like, ‘Oh, I’m retired and that’s it. I’m always open to cool opportunities, cool collaborations, it’s not really in my sight right now to pursue wrestling, but after so many years of being removed from it I certainly have a different appreciation for it.</p><p>I feel like I understand it on such a deeper level and for truly such an art form that it is. I’ll never say I’m retired and I’ll never get in a ring again, but it’s not anything that I am actively trying to make happen.”</p><p>Kaitlyn was training for a return to the ring prior to the pandemic as well. She last competed at the Mae Young Classic tournament but was defeated by Mia Yim in the second round. She is currently busy as a fitness coach, but it remains to be seen whether she will return to pro wrestling again.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your view on what Kaitlyn said?
